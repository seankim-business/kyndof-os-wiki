## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Slack Etiquette
- **@channel** - Use sparingly, only for urgent team-wide messages
- **@here** - Only message people currently online
- **DMs** - Use for 1:1 conversations, not for questions that benefit the team
- **Public channels** - Default to public team channels so others can learn from answers

### Notion Best Practices
- **Always link to source material** - Don't duplicate, link to canonical pages
- **Update task status** - Keep your tasks current so others know what's happening
- **Use templates** - Follow existing page templates for consistency

### GitHub Workflow
- **Branch naming** - Use descriptive names: `feature/costume-inventory`, `fix/broken-link`
- **Commit messages** - Clear and concise: "Add costume inventory page" not "Updates"
- **Pull requests** - Request review from relevant teammates
- **Issues** - Use for bug reports and feature requests

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access a Tool?
1. Check your email for invite links
2. Ask your team lead in Slack

### Forgot a Password?
Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page. If that doesn't work, contact Operations Lead.

### Tool Not Working?

2. Check Slack for outage announcements

4. Contact IT/Operations Lead if problem persists
