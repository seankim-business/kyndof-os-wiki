# Welcome to Kyndof

**You're here. That's the hard part done.**

This section will help you get oriented quickly. Whether this is your first day or your first week, you're in the right place.

## New Here? Start With These Three

### [Who We Are](./who-we-are/)
What Kyndof does, why we exist, and what we believe. Read this first—it gives you context for everything else.

### [Your First Week](./your-first-week/)
Day-by-day guide through your first week. What to do, who to meet, what to expect. Start with [Day 1](./your-first-week/day-1/).

### [Tools We Use](./tools-we-use/)
The software and systems you'll need access to. Your team lead will help you get set up.

## What to Expect in Week One

Your first week is about **orientation, not productivity**. You'll meet your team, set up your workspace, and learn how we work. By Friday, you should:

- Know who's on your team and how to reach them
- Have access to all the tools you need
- Understand our decision-making framework (RABSIC)
- Feel comfortable asking questions

Don't worry if it feels like drinking from a fire hose—everyone here has been the new person. We remember what it's like.

## Guiding Principles

Three things that will help you succeed at Kyndof:

**1. Position Over Person**
We organize around roles, not individuals. When you need help, look for the **role** (e.g., "Operations Lead") rather than a specific person. People change roles; roles stay stable.

**2. Ask Questions Early**
If you're confused, speak up. Silence doesn't mean everyone understands—it means everyone's waiting for someone else to ask.

**3. System Over Individual**
We trust structured processes, not heroics. You don't need to know everything—you need to know where to find answers.

## Quick Links for Common Questions

- **Who do I report to?** Check with your hiring manager or the [Operations Lead](../reference/positions.md)
- **What's my first task?** Your team lead will assign this on Day 1
- **How do I request time off?** See [How We Work → Time Off](../how-we-work/time-off.md)
- **Where's the company calendar?** Linked in [Tools We Use](./tools-we-use/)
- **What's RABSIC?** Our decision-making framework—see [Governance](../how-we-work/governance/)

## Need Help?

Ask your **team lead** or post in your team's Slack channel. Everyone here has been the new person—we're happy to help.

If you're not sure who your team lead is, contact the **Operations Lead** (see [current position holder](../reference/positions.md)).
