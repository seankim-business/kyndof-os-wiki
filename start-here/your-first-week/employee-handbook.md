# Employee Handbook: How We Think About People

**Navigation:** [Start Here](../index.md) > [Your First Week](./index.md) > **Employee Handbook**

This document explains Kyndof's philosophy about work, growth, and what we expect from each other. It's honest about who we are and what we're building. Read it carefully.

## Our Core Belief

> "People who are already good, complete work from start to finish, and grow themselves."

We're a startup. We don't have the resources or runway for three-year training programs. This isn't cold - it's realistic about what makes startups work.

---

## What This Means in Practice

### We Don't "Develop" You - We Set Clear Expectations

Large companies can invest years in growing talent. We can't.

What we do instead:
- **Clear expectations:** "In three months, you should be doing X."
- **Fast feedback:** You'll know quickly if you're on track or off.
- **Growth environment:** We create conditions where you can improve yourself.

Learning is your responsibility. We'll support it, but we won't push it.

If expectations are unclear, ask. That's on us to fix.

### We Don't Motivate You - We Reward Achievement

External motivation fades fast. The motivation to do great work needs to come from you.

What brings people to Kyndof:
- They want to grow
- They want meaningful work
- They want to be recognized
- They want to earn

What we commit to:
- Not crushing your intrinsic motivation
- Clear rewards for clear results
- No ambiguity about performance

### We Focus on Strengths, Not Weaknesses

"Good at something" = it's easy for you, hard for others.

Bringing weaknesses to average takes enormous effort. Making strengths exceptional takes the same effort with 10x the return.

If a weakness matters for the team:
- We build systems to compensate (checklists, automation)
- Teammates with complementary strengths cover it
- We reorganize around natural abilities

"I'm not great at this" is okay to say - as long as "I'm great at this" is also clear.

### Complete Work From Start to Finish

> "Strategizing without executing doesn't count."

Why this matters:
- You only know if strategy works by implementing it
- Details teach you what to improve
- A full cycle creates real learning

Expectation: Own your work end-to-end. "I handed off my part" isn't finished.

### See the Whole Value Stream

"My function is done" isn't done if the customer didn't get value.

Think beyond your role:
- What happens before your step?
- What happens after?
- What blocks the flow?

The question isn't "Did I do my part?" It's "Did value reach the customer?"

## How We Structure Roles

### Flat Organization

Too many levels create problems:
- Promotion becomes the goal (instead of performance)
- "That's above my pay grade" thinking
- Moving roles feels like demotion

Our approach:
- **Title ≠ Compensation:** Pay reflects contribution, not hierarchy
- **Role ≠ Reward:** You earn responsibility by demonstrating it

### Specialist Over Manager

Advancement doesn't mean management. Most impact at a startup comes from deep expertise, not coordination.

We want 90%+ specialists:
- Managers handle systems, not people
- Everyone focuses on what they do best
- Impact comes from craft, not oversight

---

## Who Thrives Here

People who fit well at Kyndof:
- Self-starters who don't wait to be told what to do
- Learners who improve without being pushed
- Completers who see work through to the end
- Documenters who share what they learn

**Note:** If stability is important to you, startups are inherently volatile. This might not be the right fit.

---

## Process Over Person

We reduce dependence on individuals by documenting everything.

When you learn something:
- Write it down
- The next person starts faster
- Work continues when you're not there
- You can take on bigger challenges

This isn't about replacing you. It's about freeing you for higher-impact work.
