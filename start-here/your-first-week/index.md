# Your First Week at Kyndof

**Navigation:** [Start Here](../index.md) > **Your First Week**

Welcome. Your first week is about getting oriented, not being productive. By Friday, you should know who's on your team, how to access your tools, and feel comfortable asking questions.

## Why These Documents Exist

The fashion industry traditionally operates on "watch and learn" mentoring. The problem is:
- Everyone learns different things
- Critical knowledge lives in people's heads
- When people leave, knowledge leaves with them

Kyndof documents organizational knowledge so that:
- Everyone starts from the same foundation
- Knowledge survives people changing roles
- The system improves over time

This onboarding is your entry point to that system.

## What to Expect

**Day 1:** Setup, paperwork, meet your team, get your bearings.

**Days 2-3:** Learn the tools, understand your role, start small tasks.

**Days 4-5:** Shadow teammates, ask questions, complete first real task.

Don't worry if it feels overwhelming—everyone here has been the new person. Take notes. Ask questions early and often.

## Common First-Week Questions

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**
Ask immediately. Seriously. Silence doesn't mean everyone understands—it means everyone's waiting for someone else to ask.

**Q: Who do I report to?**
Your hiring manager or team lead. If unclear, ask the Operations Lead.

**Q: What's my first task?**
Your team lead will assign this on Day 1 or Day 2. It will be small and guided.

**Q: Can I make mistakes?**
Yes. This is a learning week. Mistakes are expected and welcomed (as long as you ask for help when stuck).

**Q: How do I request time off?**
See [How We Work → Time Off](../../how-we-work/time-off.md) or ask your team lead.

**Q: What if I finish early?**
Read this wiki, review past project documentation, or shadow a teammate.

## Tips for Success

**1. Take notes.** You'll get a lot of information. Write it down. You won't remember everything.

**2. Ask questions in public channels.** Others probably have the same question. Asking in team Slack helps everyone.

**3. Don't try to be productive yet.** Focus on understanding context, not delivering results. You'll have plenty of time to contribute.

**4. Meet people.** Say hi in Slack, grab coffee (virtual or in-person), learn what others do.

**5. Review the wiki.** This is your reference. Bookmark important pages.

---

## End-of-Week Check-In

On Friday, schedule 30 minutes with your team lead to review:
- What went well this week?
- What's still confusing?
- What's your focus for Week 2?
- Any blockers or questions?

This is your chance to clarify anything before diving into real work.

4. **[How We Work](../../how-we-work/index.md)** - Operating principles
5. **[RABSIC Framework](../../how-we-work/making-decisions/rabsic/index.md)** - How we assign accountability
6. **[Work Guidelines](./work-guidelines.md)** - Daily rhythms and expectations

## Before Reading, Remember

### These documents aren't perfect
They're continually updated. If something doesn't match reality or could be clearer, tell us. That feedback makes them better.

### Don't hesitate to ask
"What does this mean?" is a question that improves our documentation. Ask your buddy, team lead, or CEO Staff.

### Reading is the start, not the end
You'll truly understand these concepts when you apply them to real work. Try to connect what you read to the tasks you're assigned.
