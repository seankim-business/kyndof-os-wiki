2. **[What We Believe](../../who-we-are/what-we-believe.md)** - Core values (10 minutes)
3. **[Tools We Use](../../tools-we-use/index.md)** - Platform overview (5 minutes)

Total reading time: ~25 minutes. You'll explore more throughout the week.

## Common Day 1 Questions

**Q: Am I supposed to do real work today?**
No. Today is setup and orientation. Real work starts Day 2 or Day 3 (and it will be small, guided tasks).

**Q: What if I don't understand something someone explains?**
Ask them to clarify immediately. Everyone here has been the new person—we get it.

**Q: Should I take notes during meetings?**
Yes. You'll get a lot of information today. Write it down.

**Q: What if I forget someone's name?**
Ask again. Seriously. No one will be offended.

**Q: Can I leave on time today?**
Absolutely. This is not a heroics culture. Leave when your workday ends.

## Tips for Your First Day

**1. Don't try to remember everything.** Take notes. Lots of notes.

**2. Ask questions early.** Don't wait until you're deeply confused.

**3. Say hi to people.** Introduce yourself in Slack and in person (if applicable).

**4. It's okay to feel overwhelmed.** This is normal. It gets easier.

**5. Focus on people, not productivity.** Learn who does what. Relationships matter more than output on Day 1.
