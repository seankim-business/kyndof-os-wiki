# Work Guidelines: Your Daily and Weekly Rhythm

**Navigation:** [Start Here](../index.md) > [Your First Week](./index.md) > **Work Guidelines**

This document explains how Kyndof wants you to work - not just what to do, but how to think about doing it. These aren't aspirational ideals; they're practical habits we use every day.

## The Core Metaphor: Rolling a Snowball

> "We're not each doing our own thing. We're rolling one snowball together."

Three questions guide everything:

1. **Which direction are we rolling?**
   Are we pushing toward the customer, or optimizing for internal convenience?

2. **Where does force have the most effect?**
   Are we strengthening the weakest link, or polishing something already strong?

3. **Does today make tomorrow easier?**
   Is this work disappearing, or becoming an asset?

Apply these to every task, meeting, project, and decision.

## Your Day Structure

### Start of Day (5-10 minutes)

**Step 1: Capture**
Scan Slack, email, Tasks DB Inbox. Pull everything you need to handle into visibility.
Don't judge yet - just capture.

**Step 2: Align**
For each item, ask:
- What Project does this Task connect to?
- What OKR/Goal does that Project serve?
- What Vision does that Goal advance?
- What's the biggest snowball to roll today?

**Step 3: Pick Your Top 3**
Maximum three things you must finish today.
- Use action verbs: "Draft Musinsa exit risk summary", not "Musinsa stuff"
- Set clear due times
- Enter in Tasks DB

### During the Day

**Work in blocks.** 60-90 minute focused sessions. One thing per block. Minimize Slack notifications during focus time.

**Update task status.** Inbox → ToDo → Doing → Done. Others should see progress without asking.

**Signal when stuck.** Don't suffer in silence. Flag blockers immediately through Tasks comments or Slack threads.

**Think value stream.** Your function finishing doesn't mean the work is done. It's done when the next person can start - or when the customer gets value.

### End of Day (5-10 minutes)

Before leaving, check:
- Did I grow the snowball today?
- Did I document anything I learned?
- Is there a failure or lesson to share?
- What are tomorrow's Top 3 (roughly)?

> "Did today make Kyndof stronger for tomorrow?"

If the answer is unclear, do something different tomorrow.

## Your Week Structure

### Weekly Start (Monday)

Team sync: Align on this week's top goals.

### Mid-Week Check

If direction feels off, talk to your lead. Five minutes of alignment beats days of wrong work.

### Weekly End (Friday)

Brief team/individual review:
- What did we ship?
- What blocked us?
- What will we do differently?

---

## Quarterly Rhythm

Every quarter, verify alignment:
- Vision → Goals → Hypothesis → Strategies → OKRs → Projects → Tasks

You should always be able to explain:
- What Project or Task am I on?
- What OKR does it serve?
- What Goal does that connect to?

If the connection is unclear:
- Lower the priority
- Reduce the scope
- Or stop the work

## Compound vs. Disappearing Work

### Disappearing Work (Avoid)

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Explaining the same thing repeatedly | No documentation |
| Fixing the same issue over and over | No root cause fix |
| Work that only you understand | Knowledge trapped in your head |
| Decisions with no record | Team can't learn from them |

### Compound Work (Pursue)

| Pattern | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Write it down once | Everyone can reference it forever |
| Fix the root cause | Problem disappears permanently |
| Create templates/checklists | Next person is faster |
| Share learnings publicly | Whole team improves |

> "What will remain when this work is done?"

If nothing, find a small way to leave something behind.

## The 50/100 Point System

### 50 Points: Task Completed

You did what was asked, on time, at the right quality.
This is baseline expectation.

### 100 Points: Task + Improvement

You completed the task AND made future work easier:
- Documented the process
- Created a reusable template
- Fixed an underlying problem
- Shared a learning with the team

**Example by role:**

| Role | 50 Points | 100 Points |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Designer | Delivered design on deadline | + created design system components |
| Sales | Closed the deal | + documented the pitch that worked |
| Operations | Processed the order | + automated the manual step |

## Collaboration: Value Stream + RABSIC

### Think Value Stream

Archives: Trend → Design → Production → Inventory → Marketing → Delivery → CS → Repurchase

Atelier: Market Opportunity → Sales → Design → Production → Delivery → Reference Archive

"Our team delivered" isn't success. "Customer received value" is success.

### Apply RABSIC

Every meaningful task has clear roles:
- **R (Responsible):** Who actually does the work today?
- **A (Accountable):** Who owns the final outcome? (One person only)
- **S (Support):** Who helps if needed?
- **C (Consulted):** Who do I ask before deciding?
- **I (Informed):** Who needs to know when it's done?

If you can't name these for your task, clarify before starting.

## Communication Principles

### Slack

- Default: Asynchronous. Don't expect instant replies.
- Urgent: DM or call. Everything else goes in channels/threads.
- No gossip. Ever. Complaints go to the person directly or through formal channels.

### Meetings

Before: Documented agenda + expected outcomes + participant list
During: Live notes in Notion with decisions and action items
After: Action items entered in Tasks DB with RABSIC assigned

### Notion

Notion is our operating system.
- **Tasks DB:** Every unit of work
- **Projects DB:** Work with clear start/end
- **Goals/KPIs/Strategies:** Direction and measurement

Rule: Important work has a Tasks or Projects entry. "It's in my head" doesn't count.

## For New Team Members

- If something doesn't make sense, ask immediately. Your questions improve our docs.
- Check the [Glossary](../../reference/glossary/index.md) for unfamiliar terms.
- If reality doesn't match this document, tell us. We want to fix it.

## Daily Reflection

> "Did I work the way Kyndof wants me to work today?"

If not: what's one thing to do differently tomorrow?
