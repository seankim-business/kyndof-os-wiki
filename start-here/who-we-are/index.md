# Who We Are

**Navigation:** [Start Here](../index.md) → **Who We Are**

Kyndof creates custom costumes for performances, events, and corporate clients. But we're more than a production company—we're craftspeople who treat every costume as a unique creative project.

---

## What We Do

Kyndof operates at the intersection of K-fashion and K-pop through two brands:

- **2000Atelier:** Custom stage costumes for K-pop artists and performers
- **2000Archives:** Retail fashion inspired by that same stage aesthetic, for everyday customers

We're not just making clothes—we're connecting the world of performance with the world of everyday style. The artist relationships we build through Atelier drive the cultural credibility of Archives. The retail scale of Archives funds better artist services at Atelier.

This isn't two separate businesses. It's one flywheel.

## How We Work

**Small teams, big impact.** We organize around functions (Design, Production, Operations) rather than rigid hierarchies. Everyone knows their role, and roles are designed to outlive any single person.

**Position over person.** We structure around positions (like "Operations Lead") not individuals. When you need help, you look for the role, not the person. This keeps the company stable as people grow and change.

**System over individual.** We trust processes, not heroics. Our decision-making framework (RABSIC) ensures clarity about who does what, who approves what, and who needs to know what.

## What Makes Us Different

### We Compete at an Intersection

Most fashion companies have one strength. We compete where three worlds meet:
- **K-fashion:** Korean design sensibility and manufacturing excellence
- **K-pop:** Entertainment industry networks and cultural credibility
- **AI tech:** Automation and intelligent operations

This intersection is rare and defensible. It's hard to copy because it requires all three.

### We're Building Something Bigger

Our vision isn't to be a good costume shop. We're building toward becoming a global fashion house—think LVMH or HYBE, but starting from K-fashion and K-pop.

**Three stages:**
1. **Now (Startup):** 10-15 people, seed funding, testing core hypotheses
2. **Mid-term (Consumer HYBE):** Reshape fashion like HYBE reshaped music
3. **Long-term (Post-LVMH):** Global luxury group rooted in Korean culture

**Reality check:** We're at stage 1. High risk, high uncertainty, massive learning curve—but also the highest potential impact for early team members.

### We Build Systems, Not Dependencies on Heroes

Traditional fashion companies break when key people leave. We document, automate, and systematize so the company outlasts individuals.

- **Position over person:** You contact roles, not individuals
- **System over individual:** Processes beat heroics
- **Documentation is an act of care:** Future teammates need what you learned today

This wiki exists because we believe knowledge should be shared, not hoarded.

## Where We Are Right Now

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | Seed/Pre-A startup |
| **Team Size** | 10-15 people |
| **Funding** | ~2.6 billion KRW raised |
| **Brands** | 2000Atelier (stage costumes), 2000Archives (retail) |
| **Primary Markets** | Korea (current), US expansion (planned) |
| **Core Hypothesis** | Artist networks drive retail sales growth |

This is a startup. That means:
- **High uncertainty** and rapid iteration
- **Early team members** create the systems that scale
- **Success = massive opportunity**, failure = fast pivot
- **Learning speed** matters more than credentials
