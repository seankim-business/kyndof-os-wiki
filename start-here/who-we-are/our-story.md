# Our Story

**Navigation:** [Start Here](../../index.md) → [Who We Are](./index.md) → **Our Story**

Every company starts with someone solving a problem they care about. Here's how Kyndof began.

---

## The Beginning

Kyndof started because high-quality costume production was either **too expensive for small groups** or **too generic for creative projects**. The market offered two bad options:
- Mass-produced costumes that looked cheap
- Custom ateliers that charged premium prices

We believed there was a third way: **craft-quality work at accessible scale**.

---

## Why "Kyndof"?

The name reflects our philosophy: not quite one thing, not quite another. We're **kind of** a production company, **kind of** an atelier, **kind of** a design studio. We resist easy categorization because the best creative work doesn't fit in boxes.

---

## What We've Built

From the start, we made three unconventional choices:

**1. Position over person**
We built roles that outlast individuals. When someone leaves, the role stays—knowledge doesn't walk out the door.

**2. Documentation as culture**
We write everything down, not because we love bureaucracy, but because systems free people to do creative work. This wiki is part of that DNA.

**3. System over heroics**
We don't rely on one person saving the day. We rely on clear processes, accountability, and teamwork.

These choices weren't easy—they required discipline—but they've let us scale without losing craft.

---

## Where We've Been

**Early Days:**
- Started with small performance groups and local events
- Focused on building repeatable processes while maintaining quality
- Learned (the hard way) that documentation is not optional

**Growth Phase:**
- Expanded into corporate events and specialty projects
- Built out Design, Production, and Operations functions
- Developed RABSIC framework for clear decision-making

**Today:**
- Working with performance groups, event organizers, and corporate clients
- Small, focused teams that care deeply about craft
- Continuously improving our processes while staying human

## What We've Learned

**Good systems take time.** You can't shortcut process design. We've rebuilt our workflows multiple times—each iteration gets better.

**Roles outlast people.** Early on, we lost critical knowledge when key people left. Now, knowledge lives in systems and roles, not in heads.

**Craft requires discipline.** You can't do quality work at scale without structure. The creative part happens *within* good systems, not despite them.

**Asking for help is strength.** We built a culture where questions are welcome because silence doesn't mean understanding—it means confusion.

---

## What Hasn't Changed

Despite growth and evolution, three things remain constant:

1. **We treat every costume as craft, not commodity**
2. **We design systems that outlast individuals**
3. **We believe documentation is an act of care for future teammates**

If you're reading this as a new team member, you're now part of that story.
