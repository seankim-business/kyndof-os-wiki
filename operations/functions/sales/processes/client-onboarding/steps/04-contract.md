```
Subject: Contract for [Project Name] - Ready for Signature

Dear [Client Name],

Attached is our service agreement for [project]. Please review and sign
electronically via DocuSign.

Once signed and your deposit is received, we'll immediately begin work and
schedule your first design review.

If you have any questions before signing, please let me know!

Best,
[Account Manager Name]
```

### 4. Post-Signature Actions (1 min)

**Once Both Parties Sign:**
- Download signed contract PDF
- Upload to Google Drive: `/Clients/[Client Name]/Contracts/`
- Upload to Notion client record (attach file)
- Update client status to "Active - In Production"
- Send contract copy to client via email
- Notify Finance to issue deposit invoice
- Create project kickoff meeting invite (client + Fashion Design + Operations)

**Notify Internal Teams:**
- **Fashion Design**: New project incoming, include creative brief
- **Operations**: Allocate production capacity, review timeline
- **Finance**: Issue deposit invoice, set up payment tracking
- **IT** (if needed): Create Slack channel for project collaboration

## Outputs
- Fully executed contract (signed by both parties)
- Client status: "Active - In Production"
- Deposit invoice sent
- Project kickoff meeting scheduled
- Internal teams notified and ready

## Success Criteria
- Contract signed within 3 days of proposal acceptance

- Project kickoff meeting scheduled within 5 days
- All stakeholders (client, design, operations) aligned on scope and timeline

## Payment Processing

**Deposit Invoice:**
- Send via QuickBooks within 24 hours of signature
- Payment methods: Bank transfer, credit card, check
- Payment terms: Due within 7 days
- Late payment: 5% fee after 7 days

**Deposit Amount:**
- Standard projects: 50% of total contract value
- High-value projects (>$10K): 40% deposit, 30% mid-project, 30% delivery
- Rush projects: 60% upfront (higher risk)

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Client delays signing | Follow up via phone, address concerns, offer contract review call |
| Client requests contract changes | Minor changes: Sales Director approval. Major changes: escalate to Legal |
| Deposit not received | Send reminder at day 5, pause work at day 7, escalate to Sales Director |
| Client loses unsigned contract | Resend DocuSign link, offer phone walkthrough if needed |
| Signature authority unclear | Request corporate resolution or proof of authority to sign |

## Red Flags (Escalate to Sales Director + Legal)
- Client refuses to sign contract (wants to work on handshake)
- Client requests removal of key protections (IP, cancellation, payment terms)
- Deposit payment bounces or is disputed
- Client unable to provide legal business name or authority
- Client requests net-60 or longer payment terms (cash flow risk)

## Legal Escalation Triggers
- Contract value > $25,000
- International client (cross-border legal issues)
- Celebrity/high-profile client (publicity rights concerns)
- Client requests unlimited revisions or open-ended scope
- Intellectual property concerns (client wants to own design outright before payment)

## Tools & Templates
- DocuSign: Electronic signature platform
- Google Drive: Contract storage (`/Clients/[Name]/Contracts/`)
- Notion: Client record status update
- QuickBooks: Invoice generation
- Standard Service Agreement template (maintained by Legal)
