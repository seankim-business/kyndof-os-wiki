## Objective
Conduct structured discovery call to understand client requirements, constraints, preferences, and collaboration style.

### 2. Introduction & Agenda (2 min)
**Script:**
```
"Thank you for joining! I'm excited to learn about your project. Over the next
15 minutes, I'll ask about your vision, timeline, budget, and collaboration
preferences. Then I'll share how Kyndof can support you and outline next steps.
Sound good?"
```

### 3. Project Discovery (8 min)

**Key Questions:**

**Vision & Requirements:**
- What type of costumes/pieces do you need? (period, contemporary, fantasy, etc.)
- How many pieces? For how many characters/people?
- What's the creative direction? (mood boards, references, inspirations)
- Any specific materials, colors, or design elements required?

**Timeline & Deadlines:**
- When do you need delivery?
- Are there fitting/revision stages we should plan for?
- What's your production schedule? (shooting dates, performances, events)
- Any hard deadlines we should know about?

**Budget & Constraints:**
- What's your budget range for this project?
- Are there cost priorities? (e.g., invest more in hero costumes vs. background)
- Any material or design constraints?

**Collaboration & Communication:**
- Who's the key decision-maker on design approvals?
- Preferred communication method? (email, Slack, phone)
- How often do you want progress updates?
- Do you need us to coordinate with other vendors? (hair/makeup, set design)

### 4. Kyndof Capabilities Presentation (3 min)
- Show 2-3 relevant portfolio examples

- Address any concerns or questions

### 5. Next Steps Agreement (2 min)

- Answer any remaining questions

## Outputs

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Client unprepared/vague requirements | Ask clarifying questions, send detailed questionnaire for async completion |
| Unrealistic timeline | Transparently explain production realities, propose phased delivery |
| Budget doesn't match scope | Present tiered options (premium/standard/economy) |
| Multiple decision-makers | Request group call or async approval workflow |
| Client rushes through call | Respectfully slow down, emphasize importance of details for accurate proposal |

## Red Flags (Escalate to Sales Director)
- Budget < $500 for complex custom work (may not be profitable)
- Timeline < 2 weeks for elaborate costumes (may be infeasible)
- Client unable to articulate vision (high revision risk)
- Multiple unclear decision-makers (approval bottleneck risk)

## Tools & Templates
- Notion: Client record template
- Zoom/Meet: Video call platform
- Google Drive: Onboarding questionnaire reference
- Slack: #sales channel for immediate questions during call
