## Pricing Guidelines

**Standard Pricing Tiers:**

| Complexity | Description | Base Price Range |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Simple | Basic alterations, simple garments | $200 - $500 |
| Standard | Custom contemporary pieces, moderate detail | $500 - $2,000 |
| Complex | Period costumes, intricate embellishment | $2,000 - $5,000 |
| Premium | Historical reproductions, couture-level work | $5,000+ |

**Add-ons:**

- Complex embellishment: +$500-$2,000
- Historical research: $300/costume
- On-set alterations: $100/hour + travel

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Client requests major scope changes | Create addendum or revised proposal, don't overwrite original |
| Pricing seems high to client | Break down cost components (materials, labor, overhead) to show value |
| Timeline too long for client | Offer rush option with premium pricing, or phase delivery |
| Client wants to skip fittings | Explain quality risk, offer virtual fitting option |
| Multiple internal approvers | Create summary slide deck in addition to detailed proposal |

## Red Flags (Escalate to Sales Director)
- Client requests spec work (free design samples)
- Client unwilling to commit to deposit
- Scope creep during proposal stage
- Client compares pricing to mass production (misaligned expectations)

## Tools & Templates
