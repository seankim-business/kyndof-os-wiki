## Phone Call Scripts

### Script 1: Needs Assessment Call Opening

**Tone:** Warm, structured, professional

```
"Hi [Client Name], this is [Your Name] from Kyndof. Thank you so much for joining me today!

I'm really excited to learn about your project. Over the next 15 minutes, I'd like to ask you about your vision, timeline, budget, and how you prefer to collaborate. Then I'll share how Kyndof can support you and outline our next steps together.

Sound good? Great! Let's dive in.

First, tell me about the project. What are you creating, and what role do the costumes play?"

[Listen actively, take notes in Notion]
```

---

### Script 2: Handling Pricing Questions

**When:** Client asks "How much will this cost?" early in conversation
**Approach:** Educate, gather info, set expectations

```
"That's a great question, and I want to make sure I give you an accurate number. Our pricing depends on a few factors:

- The complexity of the design (period accuracy, embellishments, materials)
- The number of pieces you need
- Your timeline (rush projects have premium pricing)
- Number of fittings and revisions

To give you a ballpark: [Simple/Standard/Complex] projects typically range from [$ Low] to [$ High].

Based on what you've shared so far, I'd estimate your project would fall in the [Range] range. Once we complete this needs assessment, I'll send you a detailed proposal with exact pricing within 24 hours.

Does that timeframe work for you?"
```

---

### Script 3: Handling Objections

**Objection:** "Your pricing seems high compared to [mass production/online retailers]."

**Response:**
```
"I completely understand—there's a big difference between mass-produced costumes and custom, handcrafted pieces.

Here's what you're investing in with Kyndof:
- One-of-a-kind designs tailored exactly to your vision
- Professional-grade materials that photograph beautifully and last through productions
- Expert pattern making and construction (our lead designer has [X years] experience)
- Dedicated fittings to ensure perfect fit and movement
- Direct collaboration with you throughout the process

Mass production is great for standardized needs, but if you need something truly unique that elevates your [production/event], custom is the way to go.

That said, I'm happy to discuss ways to work within your budget—maybe we focus premium effort on hero pieces and use simpler construction for background costumes?"
```

---

**Objection:** "I need this faster than your timeline allows."

**Response:**
```
"I hear you—timelines are tight in [theater/film/events]! Let me be transparent about what's feasible.

Our standard process is [X weeks] to ensure quality and proper fittings. If you need it sooner, we do offer rush service:
- [Rush timeline]: +30% rush fee, prioritized in our production schedule
- [Ultra-rush timeline]: +50% rush fee, requires overtime and weekend work

Alternatively, if we simplify the design or reduce the number of pieces, we might hit your timeline without rush fees.

What feels like the right trade-off for you—timeline, budget, or scope?"
```

## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate to Sales Director

**Immediate Escalation:**
- Client requests contract terms outside standard template
- Pricing negotiation below minimum margin (20%)
- Celebrity/high-profile client (reputation risk)
- Legal or intellectual property concerns
- Client threatening or abusive behavior

**24-Hour Escalation:**
- Client requests spec work (free design samples)
- Payment dispute or deposit delay beyond 7 days
- Scope creep exceeding 20% of original proposal
- Client unable to make decisions (approval bottleneck)

**How to Escalate:**
1. Send Slack DM to Sales Director with summary
2. Tag in Notion client record with "@Sales Director - Need Approval"
3. For urgent issues: Call directly

---

## Communication No-Nos

**Never Say:**
- "I don't know" (instead: "Let me find out and get back to you within [timeframe]")
- "That's not my job" (instead: "I'll connect you with [appropriate person]")
- "We can't do that" (instead: "Here's what we can do...")
- Promise specific designs/outcomes without Designer approval
- Quote pricing without verifying with Finance

**Never Do:**
- Commit to timelines without checking Operations capacity
- Offer discounts >10% without Sales Director approval
- Send proposals without internal review
- Skip needs assessment and jump straight to proposal
- Ignore client for >4 hours during business day

---

## Slack Communication

### When to Use Slack vs. Email with Clients

**Slack Preferred:**
- Quick updates during active production
- Informal check-ins
- Sharing in-progress photos
- Rapid back-and-forth on design details

**Email Required:**
- Formal proposals and contracts
- Payment requests and invoicing
- Major scope or timeline changes
- Anything requiring legal record

### Internal Slack Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#sales` | General sales team coordination |
| `#sales-leads` | New lead notifications and assignments |
| `#project-[client-name]` | Client-specific project collaboration |
| `#sales-wins` | Celebrate closed deals! |

---

## Brand Voice Examples

**Good Examples:**

✅ "We'd love to bring your 1920s vision to life! Our team specializes in period-accurate costumes with authentic construction techniques."

✅ "I understand timelines are tight. Let's explore what's possible—I'll check with our production team and get back to you within 2 hours."

✅ "That's a fantastic reference image! Our designer will be excited to work with that aesthetic."

**Bad Examples:**

❌ "We do costumes." (too terse, not inspiring)

❌ "Wow, that's a really challenging timeline—I don't think we can do it." (negative framing)

❌ "Per your request, attached please find the proposal." (too formal/robotic)

---

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

**Inclusive Language:**
- Use gender-neutral terms unless client specifies preference
- Avoid assumptions about body types or sizes
- Respect cultural sensitivities in costume design
- Offer virtual fitting options for remote clients
- Provide alternative communication methods (email, phone, Slack, video)

**Accommodation Examples:**
- ASL interpreter available for video calls (upon request)
- Large-print proposal formats (upon request)
- Flexible meeting times for different time zones
- Async communication options for neurodiverse clients

---

## Metrics & Quality Checks

**Track in Notion:**
- Response time (target: <4 hours for initial contact)
- Proposal conversion rate (target: >40%)
- Client satisfaction score post-onboarding (target: ≥4/5)
- Time from initial contact to signed contract (target: <7 days)

**Monthly Review:**
Sales team reviews communication metrics and discusses:
- Which templates are most effective
- Common objections and how to improve responses
- Client feedback on communication quality
- SOP updates needed
