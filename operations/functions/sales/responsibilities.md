## Matrix Notes

### RABSIC Role Definitions
- **R (Responsible)**: Does the work, delivers the output
- **A (Accountable)**: Final authority, approver, owns outcome (exactly ONE per decision)
- **B (Backup)**: Stand-in if Responsible unavailable
- **S (Support)**: Actively assists Responsible, provides resources
- **I (Informed)**: Receives notification AFTER decision made (passive)
- **C (Consulted)**: Provides input/expertise BEFORE decision (two-way communication)

### Key Principles
1. **Exactly ONE Accountable** per decision - single point of ownership
2. **Consulted BEFORE, Informed AFTER** - timing matters
3. **Support is active, Informed is passive** - different engagement levels
4. **Backup only activated when Responsible unavailable** - not a co-owner
