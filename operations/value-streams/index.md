# Value Streams

Value streams represent the end-to-end flows of value delivery through our organization. Each value stream captures the complete journey from customer request to delivered value.

## Overview

A value stream includes:
- All stages from trigger to completion
- Activities within each stage
- Inputs and outputs
- Responsible positions (RABSIC)
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Performance metrics

## Active Value Streams

### [Costume Order to Delivery](costume-order-to-delivery/)

Our primary value stream covering the complete costume production lifecycle:
- **Total Lead Time:** 17-29 days
- **Stages:** 5 (Order Reception → Design → Pattern Making → Production → Delivery)
- **Owner Position:** Production Manager
- **Key Metrics:** Lead time, quality score, client satisfaction

## Using Value Streams

Value streams help us:
1. **Visualize work flow** - See the complete journey
2. **Identify bottlenecks** - Find delays and constraints
3. **Standardize processes** - Consistent execution via SOPs
4. **Measure performance** - Track lead time and quality
5. **Improve continuously** - Data-driven optimization

## RABSIC in Value Streams

Each stage has a clear accountability matrix:
- **R (Responsible)** - Does the work
- **A (Accountable)** - Owns the outcome
- **B (Backup)** - Covers when R unavailable
- **S (Support)** - Helps R complete work
- **I (Informed)** - Notified after completion
- **C (Consulted)** - Provides input before decisions
