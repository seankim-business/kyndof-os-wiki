# Metric: Lead Time

**Definition:** Total calendar days from client inquiry to costume delivery

**Target:** 21 days (typical case)
**Range:** 17-29 days

## Lead Time Breakdown

```
Order Reception:      1 day     (5%)
Design Development:   6 days    (29%)
Pattern Making:       4 days    (19%)
Production:          10 days    (48%)
Delivery:             2 days    (10%)
──────────────────────────────────
Total:               23 days   (100%)
```

## Lead Time Distribution

| Scenario | Days | Frequency | Drivers |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Minimum** | 17 | 10% | Simple design, standard materials, no revisions |
| **Fast** | 19-20 | 20% | Simple design, client quick to approve |
| **Typical** | 21-23 | 50% | Moderate complexity, one revision round |
| **Slow** | 24-26 | 15% | Complex design, material delays |
| **Maximum** | 27-29 | 5% | Major revisions, specialty materials |

## Bottleneck Analysis

Most common delays occur at:

1. **Design Approval** (35% of delays)
   - Client indecision adds 2-3 days
   - **Mitigation:** Clearer concept presentation, guided decision-making

2. **Material Sourcing** (25% of delays)
   - Specialty fabrics add 3-7 days
   - **Mitigation:** Maintain inventory of common fabrics, identify backup options early

3. **Production Embellishment** (20% of delays)
   - Complex beading/embroidery adds 2-5 days
   - **Mitigation:** Better time estimation during design, schedule embellishment work earlier

4. **Final Fitting Scheduling** (15% of delays)
   - Client unavailability adds 1-2 days
   - **Mitigation:** Schedule fitting during production phase, not after

5. **Pattern Revision** (5% of delays)
   - Fit issues add 1-2 days
   - **Mitigation:** More thorough mockups for complex designs

## Lead Time Improvement Targets

| Quarter | Target Average | Improvement Initiative |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Q1 2026 | 21 days | Baseline measurement |
| Q2 2026 | 20 days | Reduce design approval delays |
| Q3 2026 | 19 days | Optimize material sourcing |
| Q4 2026 | 19 days | Maintain and refine |
