# Value Stream Metrics

Performance measurement for the Costume Order to Delivery value stream.

## Key Metrics

### [Lead Time](lead-time.md)
Total time from client inquiry to delivery

**Target:** 21 days (typical case)
**Range:** 17-29 days

### [Quality Metrics](quality-metrics.md)
Quality scores across all stages

**Targets:**
- Brief Completeness: >95%
- First-Round Design Approval: >60%
- First-Pass Quality: >90%
- Client Satisfaction: >90%

## Measurement Approach

Metrics are tracked for each project in Notion and aggregated monthly.

### Data Collection Points

| Stage | Metric | When Collected |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Order Reception | Brief completeness | At stage completion |
| Design Development | First-round approval rate | After client review |
| Design Development | Revision count | At stage completion |
| Pattern Making | First-fit success | After mockup or first fitting |
| Production | First-pass quality | At quality inspection |
| Production | On-time production | At stage completion |
| Delivery | Fit success (no major alterations) | At final fitting |
| Delivery | Client satisfaction score | 7 days after delivery |
