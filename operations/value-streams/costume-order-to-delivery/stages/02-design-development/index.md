## Inputs

| Input | Source | Required Information |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Documented Brief | Client Relations Manager | Character, event, requirements |
| Reference Images | Client | Visual inspiration |
| Timeline Constraints | Production Manager | Available time for design iteration |
| Budget Constraints | Client Relations Manager | Material budget allocation |

## Activities

### [1. Concept Development](activities/concept-development.md) (2-3 days)
Research character, period, and context. Develop 3-5 distinct concept directions.

**Deliverable:** Concept sketches showing silhouette, proportion, key details

### [2. Material Selection](activities/material-selection.md) (1-2 days)
Identify fabrics, trims, closures, and special materials for each concept.

**Deliverable:** Material swatches, supplier info, cost estimates

### [3. Design Approval](activities/design-approval.md) (2 days)
Present concepts to client, gather feedback, refine selected direction.

**Deliverable:** Client-approved final design with material list

## Outputs

| Output | Format | Delivered To |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Final Design Sketches | Digital (annotated) | Pattern Maker |
| Material Specifications | Spreadsheet + swatches | Production Manager |
| Color Palette | Digital swatch card | Production Manager |
| Construction Notes | Document | Pattern Maker |
| Client Approval | Signed approval form | Client Relations Manager |

## RABSIC Matrix

| Role | Position | Specific Responsibility |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| **A** (Accountable) | Creative Director | Owns design quality and client approval |
| **R** (Responsible) | Creative Director | Creates concepts, selects materials |
| **S** (Support) | Design Assistant | Researches references, prepares swatches |
| **C** (Consulted) | Pattern Maker | Advises on construction feasibility |
| **C** (Consulted) | Client | Provides feedback and final approval |
| **I** (Informed) | Production Manager | Receives approved design for production planning |

## Quality Gate

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Client has signed design approval form
- [ ] All materials identified with supplier and SKU
- [ ] Color palette documented with Pantone or RGB values
- [ ] Construction notes explain assembly approach
- [ ] Budget still within client's approved range
- [ ] Timeline still feasible for production

**Failure Action:**
If client doesn't approve any concepts, conduct additional research round (adds 2-3 days to timeline).

## Standard Operating Procedures

See [SOPs](sops/) for detailed procedures:
- **[Concept Presentation SOP](sops/sop-concept-presentation.md)** - How to present designs effectively
- **[Material Sourcing SOP](sops/sop-material-sourcing.md)** - Finding and costing materials

## Common Issues

| Issue | Frequency | Mitigation |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Client loves parts of multiple concepts | 50% | Offer hybrid concept combining elements |
| Material not available in needed quantity | 30% | Identify 2-3 backup options during selection |
| Client requests major changes after approval | 20% | Charge revision fee, explain timeline impact |
| Budget exceeded by material costs | 15% | Present value-engineered alternatives |

## Revision Policy

**Included:**
- Two rounds of concept revisions
- Minor tweaks to approved design (color, trim, small details)

**Additional Cost:**
- Third round of concepts: $150
- Major changes after approval: $200 + timeline extension
- Complete redesign: Restart design phase, additional 5-7 days

## Success Metrics

- **First-Round Approval Rate:** Target >60% (client approves one of initial concepts)
- **Total Revisions:** Target <2 rounds per project
- **Material Accuracy:** Target >95% (materials as-specified are available)

## Timeline Scenarios

| Scenario | Duration | Trigger |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Simple Design** | 5 days | Modern costume, minimal research needed |
| **Typical Design** | 6 days | Period costume, moderate research |
| **Complex Design** | 7 days | Intricate details, extensive research |
| **With Revision** | +1-2 days | Client requests changes |
| **Major Redesign** | +5-7 days | Client rejects all concepts |
