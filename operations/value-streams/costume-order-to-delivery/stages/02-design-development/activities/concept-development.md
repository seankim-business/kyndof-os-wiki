# Activity: Concept Development

**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Owner:** Creative Director
**Prerequisites:** Approved brief with reference images
**Output:** 3-5 concept sketches showing distinct design directions

## Purpose

Research the character, period, and context thoroughly, then create multiple design concepts that interpret the brief in different creative directions.

## Process

### 1. Research Phase (4-8 hours)

**Historical/Period Research:**
- If period costume: Research clothing silhouettes, fabrics, construction methods of the era
- Identify historical accuracy requirements vs. theatrical interpretation
- Document social class, occupation, regional variations

**Character Research:**
- Study source material (film, book, game, theatre script)
- Analyze character personality, role, arc
- Identify symbolic colors, motifs, character evolution

**Reference Gathering:**
- Collect 20-50 reference images
- Organize by: silhouette, color palette, texture, details, historical accuracy
- Create mood board in design software

### 2. Concept Sketching (1-2 days)

**Generate 3-5 Distinct Concepts:**

| Concept Type | Approach | When to Use |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Literal** | Directly from source material | Client wants accuracy |
| **Stylized** | Artistic interpretation | Theatrical or fantasy context |
| **Modern** | Contemporary twist on period | Fashion-forward events |
| **Practical** | Function over form | Action-heavy performance |
| **Luxury** | Premium materials, details | High budget, showcase piece |

**Each Sketch Must Show:**
- Front view (full body)
- Key detail callouts (closure method, embellishment, special features)
- Color palette (4-6 colors)
- Fabric suggestions (texture notes)
- Silhouette description (fitted, flowing, structured, etc.)

### 3. Annotation (2-4 hours)

Add notes to each sketch explaining:
- Design rationale (why this direction?)
- Key features (what makes it special?)
- Construction approach (how it's built)
- Estimated complexity (simple/moderate/complex)

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All concepts are visually distinct (not minor variations)
- [ ] Each concept addresses all brief requirements
- [ ] Sketches are clear enough for client to visualize final costume
- [ ] Color palettes are documented
- [ ] Construction feasibility reviewed with Pattern Maker
- [ ] Concepts span range of budgets/timelines
