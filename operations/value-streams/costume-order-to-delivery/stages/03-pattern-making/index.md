# Stage 3: Pattern Making

**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Owner:** Pattern Maker
**Trigger:** Client-approved design from Design Development
**Completion:** Final pattern with cut list and construction notes

## Purpose

Translate approved design into technical construction patterns that ensure proper fit and guide production.

## Process Flow

## Inputs

| Input | Source | Required Information |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Approved Design | Creative Director | Final sketches, construction notes |
| Client Measurements | Client/Fitting Session | Full body measurements |
| Material Specifications | Creative Director | Fabric types, stretch properties |

## Activities

### [1. Measurement Collection](activities/measurement-collection.md) (0.5-1 day)
Collect or verify all measurements, schedule fitting if needed.

### [2. Pattern Development](activities/pattern-development.md) (2-3 days)
Draft pattern pieces, create mockup if complex.

### [3. Technical Specifications](activities/technical-specs.md) (0.5-1 day)
Generate cut list, seam allowances, construction sequence.

## Outputs

| Output | Format | Delivered To |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Final Pattern | Paper/Digital | Production Manager |
| Cut List | Document | Production Team |
| Construction Notes | Document | Production Team |
| Mockup Photos | Digital (if applicable) | Client + Creative Director |

## RABSIC Matrix

| Role | Position | Specific Responsibility |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| **A** (Accountable) | Pattern Maker | Owns pattern accuracy and fit |
| **R** (Responsible) | Pattern Maker | Drafts patterns, tests fit |
| **S** (Support) | Production Assistant | Helps with mockup construction |
| **C** (Consulted) | Creative Director | Confirms pattern matches design intent |
| **I** (Informed) | Production Manager | Receives pattern for production scheduling |

## Quality Gate

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All measurements collected and verified
- [ ] Pattern pieces labeled and numbered
- [ ] Seam allowances marked
- [ ] Grain lines indicated
- [ ] Construction sequence documented
- [ ] Mockup approved (if required)

## SOPs

See [SOPs](sops/):
- **[Pattern Creation SOP](sops/sop-pattern-creation.md)**

## Success Metrics

- **First-Fit Success:** Target >85% (costume fits without major alterations)
- **Pattern Accuracy:** Target >95% (measurements transfer correctly)
