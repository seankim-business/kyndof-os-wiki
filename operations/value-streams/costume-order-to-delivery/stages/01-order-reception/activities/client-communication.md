## Handling Objections

### "The price is too high"

**Response Options:**

**Explain Value:**
"This price reflects [X] hours of skilled labor, custom pattern work, and quality materials that will last. Mass-produced costumes in this quality range cost [comparable amount] but won't fit as well."

**Offer Tiers:**
"We can simplify the design to $[Lower Amount] by using standard fabrics and reducing embellishment. Would you like to see that option?"

**Stand Firm:**
"We price our work to reflect the quality and craftsmanship we deliver. We can't reduce the price without compromising quality."

### "The timeline is too long"

**Response Options:**

**Explain Process:**
"Design takes [X] days because we create custom concepts just for you. Production takes [Y] days because each costume is individually constructed. We can't rush these steps without quality suffering."

**Offer Rush:**
"We can expedite to [X] days for a 50% rush fee ($[Amount] additional). This requires clearing our production queue."

**Suggest Alternatives:**
"For your deadline, we could offer a simpler design that takes [X] days, or we can recommend rental options."

### "Can I see examples first?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely! Here are [3-5] examples of similar work we've done:"
- Show portfolio images
- Highlight comparable complexity
- Explain what made each project successful

"Would you like references from past clients?"

### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course! Take the time you need. A few things to keep in mind:"
- "Our production queue fills up, so timeline may extend if you wait"
- "Material prices can fluctuate, so quote is valid for [X] days"
- "What questions can I answer to help you decide?"

**Follow-up:**
- Send recap email with proposal attached
- Schedule follow-up in 3-5 days
