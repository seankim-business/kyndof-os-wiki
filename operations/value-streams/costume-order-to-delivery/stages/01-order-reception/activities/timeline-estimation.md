# Activity: Timeline Estimation

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes
**Owner:** Client Relations Manager (with Production Manager input)
**Prerequisites:** Completed brief
**Output:** Timeline estimate with best/typical/worst case scenarios

## Purpose

Calculate realistic delivery timeline based on costume complexity, material availability, and current production queue.

## Estimation Model

### Base Timeline

```
Order Reception:      1 day    (fixed)
Design Development:   5-7 days (variable by complexity)
Pattern Making:       3-5 days (variable by fit complexity)
Production:           7-14 days (variable by techniques)
Delivery:             1-2 days (variable by fitting needs)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                17-29 days
```

### Complexity Factors

#### Design Complexity

| Level | Description | Design Time | Example |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple** | Basic garments, minimal details | 5 days | Modern casual wear, simple robes |
| **Moderate** | Period accuracy, some embellishment | 6 days | Victorian dress, basic armor |
| **Complex** | Intricate details, multiple pieces | 7 days | Elaborate ball gown, full plate armor |

#### Construction Complexity

| Level | Description | Production Time | Example |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Simple** | Straightforward sewing, basic fabrics | 7 days | Cotton tunic, simple pants |
| **Moderate** | Multiple layers, interfacing, linings | 10 days | Structured jacket, layered dress |
| **Complex** | Advanced techniques, embellishment | 14 days | Beaded gown, leather armor, metalwork |

#### Special Factors

| Factor | Time Impact | When It Applies |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Custom dyeing** | +2-3 days | Specific color not available commercially |
| **Specialty materials** | +3-7 days | Ordering leather, chainmail, rare fabrics |
| **Armor/prosthetics** | +5-10 days | EVA foam armor, silicone prosthetics |
| **Heavy embellishment** | +2-5 days | Beading, embroidery, appliqué |
| **Multiple characters** | +3 days per character | Group costumes |
| **Rush order** | -30% time (with +50% cost) | Client pays premium |

### Production Queue Impact

Current queue affects start date:

| Queue Status | Delay | Current Projects |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| **Light** | 0 days | 0-1 active projects |
| **Normal** | +2-3 days | 2-3 active projects |
| **Heavy** | +5-7 days | 4+ active projects |

**Check with Production Manager** for current queue status.

## Estimation Process

### Step 1: Assess Complexity

Review brief and assign complexity levels:

**Design Complexity Checklist:**
- [ ] Historical period? (+1 level)
- [ ] Multiple costume pieces? (+1 level)
- [ ] Intricate patterns/embroidery? (+1 level)
- [ ] Character-specific details? (neutral)

**Construction Complexity Checklist:**
- [ ] Structured garments (corsets, tailored jackets)? (+1 level)
- [ ] Multiple fabric layers? (+1 level)
- [ ] Advanced techniques (pleating, smocking)? (+1 level)
- [ ] Special materials (leather, vinyl, metallic)? (+1 level)

### Step 2: Calculate Base Timeline

Use complexity matrix:

| Design | Construction | Base Timeline |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Simple | Simple | 17 days |
| Simple | Moderate | 20 days |
| Simple | Complex | 24 days |
| Moderate | Simple | 18 days |
| Moderate | Moderate | 21 days (typical) |
| Moderate | Complex | 25 days |
| Complex | Simple | 19 days |
| Complex | Moderate | 22 days |
| Complex | Complex | 29 days |

### Step 3: Add Special Factors

Add time for any special factors identified in brief:

```
Base Timeline: [From matrix]
+ Custom dyeing: [0 or 2-3 days]
+ Specialty materials: [0 or 3-7 days]
+ Armor/prosthetics: [0 or 5-10 days]
+ Heavy embellishment: [0 or 2-5 days]
+ Additional characters: [0 or 3 days × count]
────────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Timeline: [Sum]
```

### Step 4: Add Queue Delay

Consult with Production Manager on current queue:

```
Adjusted Timeline: [From Step 3]
+ Queue delay: [0, 2-3, or 5-7 days]
────────────────────────────────────────
Total Timeline: [Final]
```

### Step 5: Generate Scenarios

Present three scenarios to client:

```
Best Case:    [Total - 2 days]  "If everything goes perfectly"
Typical Case: [Total]           "Most likely timeline"
Worst Case:   [Total + 3 days]  "If we encounter delays"
```

## Example Estimation

**Brief Summary:**
- Character: Victorian-era noblewoman
- Event: Historical reenactment
- Complexity: Moderate design, moderate construction
- Special: Custom dye for fabric (+2 days), beaded bodice (+3 days)
- Queue: Normal (+2 days)

**Calculation:**

```
Base (Moderate/Moderate):  21 days
Custom dyeing:             +2 days
Beaded bodice:             +3 days
Queue delay:               +2 days
────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Timeline:         28 days

Scenarios:
- Best Case:    26 days (if materials arrive early)
- Typical Case: 28 days (expected)
- Worst Case:   31 days (if bead application takes longer)
```

**Present to Client:**
"We can deliver your Victorian costume in approximately **4 weeks** (28 days). Best case is 3.5 weeks if everything proceeds smoothly. To be safe, plan for up to 4.5 weeks in case we encounter any challenges with the beading work."

## Timeline Presentation

### Visual Timeline

        ████████████████████

Week 2: Design Approval + Pattern Making (Days 8-14)
        ████████████████████

Week 3: Production - Cutting & Assembly (Days 15-21)

        ████████████████████

Week 5: Delivery (Days 29-30 if needed)
        ████
```

### Milestone Dates

If today is [Start Date], provide specific calendar dates:

| Milestone | Date | What Happens |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| Brief Complete | [Today] | Project officially starts |
| Design Review | [Start + 6 days] | Client reviews design concepts |
| Design Approved | [Start + 8 days] | Pattern making begins |
| Mockup Ready | [Start + 13 days] | Client approves fit |
| Production Start | [Start + 14 days] | Cutting and sewing begins |
| Quality Check | [Start + 26 days] | Final inspection |
| Delivery | [Start + 28 days] | Final fitting and handover |

## Managing Expectations

### When Timeline Exceeds Deadline

**Problem:** Client needs costume in 20 days, estimate is 28 days

**Options:**
1. **Rush Order:** Offer expedited timeline (-30% time) for +50% cost
   - "We can deliver in 20 days for $1200 instead of $800"
2. **Simplify Design:** Reduce complexity to shorten timeline
   - "If we skip the beading, we can deliver in 23 days"
3. **Decline Gracefully:** If truly impossible
   - "We can't meet that deadline while maintaining our quality standards"

### Buffer Communication

Always present "Typical Case" as the main timeline, with "Best/Worst" as context:

✅ **Good:** "We'll deliver in 4 weeks, possibly as early as 3.5 weeks if materials arrive quickly."

❌ **Bad:** "It'll take 3.5 to 4.5 weeks." (Too vague)

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting timeline to client:

- [ ] Complexity assessed using standard checklist
- [ ] All special factors identified and time-costed
- [ ] Production Manager consulted on queue status
- [ ] Three scenarios calculated (Best/Typical/Worst)
- [ ] Specific calendar dates provided
- [ ] Timeline aligns with client deadline (or alternatives proposed)

## Handoff

Timeline is presented to:
- **Client** - For approval as part of proposal
- **Production Manager** - For production schedule planning
