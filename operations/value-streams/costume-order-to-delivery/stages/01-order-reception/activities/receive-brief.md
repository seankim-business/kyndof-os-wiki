## Common Issues

### Vague Character Description

**Problem:** Client says "I want a medieval princess costume"

**Solution:**
- Ask: Which historical period? (Early/High/Late Medieval)
- Ask: Which region? (English, French, German, etc.)
- Ask: What is her status? (Minor noble, queen, warrior princess)
- Show reference images: "More like this or like this?"

### Budget Misalignment

**Problem:** Client budget is $300, costume requires $800

**Solution:**
- Explain why: "Complex embroidery adds $200, armor adds $300"
- Offer tiers: "We can do simplified version for $400, or full version for $800"
- Be honest: "At $300, we can't deliver the quality you're envisioning"

### Unrealistic Timeline

**Problem:** Client needs costume in 5 days, minimum is 17 days

**Solution:**
- Explain process: "Design takes 5-7 days, production takes 7-14 days"
- Offer rush fee: "We can expedite for +50% if we clear production queue"
- Suggest rental: "For this timeline, renting might be more feasible"
