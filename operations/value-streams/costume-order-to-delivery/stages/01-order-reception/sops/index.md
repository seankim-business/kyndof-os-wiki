# Order Reception SOPs

Standard Operating Procedures for repeatable tasks in the Order Reception stage.

## Available SOPs

### [Brief Intake SOP](sop-brief-intake.md)

**Purpose:** Ensure complete and consistent brief capture for every project

**When to Use:** During initial client consultation (phone, video, or in-person)

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

**Output:** Completed brief document ready for design development

## SOP Structure

Each SOP includes:
- **Objective** - What this SOP achieves
- **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
- **Step-by-Step Process** - Detailed instructions
- **Quality Checks** - How to verify success
- **Common Issues** - Troubleshooting guide
- **Tools & Templates** - Supporting resources

## When to Use SOPs

SOPs standardize our most critical, repeatable tasks:

✅ **Use SOP when:**
- Task is performed regularly (weekly or more)
- Task has clear steps that don't change
- Consistency is critical to quality
- Training new team members

❌ **Don't need SOP when:**
- Task is one-off or highly variable
- Task requires significant creative judgment
- Process is still being refined

## SOP Maintenance

SOPs are living documents:

- **Review Frequency:** Quarterly
- **Update Trigger:** Process change, quality issue identified
- **Owner:** Position responsible for the activity
- **Approver:** Stage owner (Client Relations Manager)

**Suggest Improvements:**
If you find a better way to do something, document it and suggest an SOP update to the Stage Owner.
