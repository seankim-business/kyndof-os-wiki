## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

   - "Thank you for choosing us for your costume project!"
   - "I'm [Name], and I'll be your main contact throughout this process."

2. **Explain consultation purpose**
   - "Today we'll discuss your character, timeline, and budget."
   - "This usually takes 30-60 minutes."
   - "At the end, you'll receive a complete proposal with timeline and pricing."

3. **Confirm consultation format**
   - "I'll ask you a series of questions to understand exactly what you need."
   - "Feel free to interrupt with questions anytime."
   - "Do you have reference images handy? We'll need those."

4. **Open brief template in Notion**
   - Navigate to `Templates > Costume Brief Template`
   - Click "Duplicate" to create new project brief
   - Rename: `[Client Name] - [Character Name] Brief`

### Phase 2: Character & Context (10-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand the character vision completely

**Script Questions:**

1. **"What character is this costume for?"**
   - Capture: Character name, source material

3. **"Do you have reference images?"**
   - Collect ALL reference images

   - Ask: "Which image is closest to what you envision?"

4. **"Tell me about the character's personality and role."**
   - Capture: Character description (2-3 sentences)
   - Example: "She's a fierce warrior, leader of her clan, confident but caring"
   - This informs fabric choices and construction decisions

5. **"Are there specific scenes or actions this costume must support?"**
   - Capture: Action requirements

   - Ask: "What is your event date?"
   - **Critical:** This is non-negotiable date

2. **"Is there a preferred delivery date before that deadline?"**
   - Capture: Preferred date (optional)

   - Capture: Measurement status (provided/pending/scheduled)

2. **"What are your height and weight?"**

## Quality Checks

### During Consultation

- [ ] All required fields in brief template are filled
- [ ] No "TBD" or blank fields remain
- [ ] Client has provided or scheduled measurement session
- [ ] At least 2 reference images collected

### After Consultation

- [ ] Brief document saved to Notion project folder
- [ ] Reference images saved to `Projects/[Client Name]/References/`
- [ ] Brief marked as "Complete" in Notion
- [ ] Handoff email sent to Creative Director (if moving forward)

### Completeness Test

**A complete brief must answer:**
1. WHO is the character?
2. WHAT is it for (event type)?
3. WHEN is the deadline?
4. WHERE will reference images be found?
5. WHY specific design choices (action requirements, character traits)?
6. HOW MUCH is the budget?

If you can't answer all 6, brief is incomplete.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Client has vague character description

**Problem:** Client says "I want a fairy costume" with no details

**Solution:**
- Show reference images: "More like this or like this?"
- Ask clarifying questions: "What type of fairy? Forest, glamorous, dark?"
- Probe inspiration: "What inspired you to choose a fairy?"
- Document: "Client wants whimsical forest fairy with earth tones"

### Issue 2: Client can't provide budget

**Problem:** Client says "I don't know what this should cost"

**Solution:**
- Give range: "Our costumes typically run $500-$2000 depending on complexity"
- Show tiers: "Simple designs start at $500, elaborate designs can reach $2000"
- Ask ceiling: "What's the most you'd want to invest?"
- Document range even if broad: "$500-$1500"

### Issue 3: Unrealistic timeline

**Problem:** Client needs costume in 1 week, minimum is 17 days

**Solution:**
- Explain process: "Design alone takes 5-7 days, production takes 7-14 days"
- Offer rush: "We can expedite for 50% premium if we clear the queue"
- Suggest alternatives: "For this timeline, renting might be better"
- Be honest: "We can't deliver quality work in that timeframe"

### Issue 4: Client doesn't have measurements

**Problem:** Client doesn't know their measurements

**Solution:**
- Provide measurement guide: Send link or PDF with instructions
- Schedule measurement session: "Can you come in [date/time]?"
- Use standard sizes as starting point: "What's your typical dress/suit size?"
- Mark as pending: "We'll finalize pattern once we have measurements"

### Issue 5: Budget and expectations don't align

**Problem:** Client wants elaborate ball gown for $300

**Solution:**
- Explain cost drivers: "Elaborate gowns require 40+ hours labor plus expensive fabrics"
- Offer simplified version: "We can do a simpler dress for $500"
- Recommend alternatives: "For $300, consider renting or buying ready-made"
- Don't compromise quality: "We can't deliver what you envision at that price point"

## Handoff

Once brief is complete:

1. **Immediate:**
   - Mark brief status as "Complete" in Notion
   - Move to "Timeline Estimation" activity

2. **After proposal accepted:**
   - Notify Creative Director: "New project ready for design development"
   - Share brief document link
   - Provide timeline expectations

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track

- **Brief Completeness:** Target >95% (all fields filled)
- **Consultation Duration:** Target 30-60 minutes (track if consistently over/under)
- **Revision Requests:** Track how often we need to re-consult for missing info

### Feedback Loop

- If Creative Director requests clarification >2 times per project, brief quality needs improvement
- If clients frequently surprised by timeline/cost, expectations setting needs work
- Review this SOP quarterly and update based on lessons learned
