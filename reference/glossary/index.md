---

## A

### A-Tier Talent
High capability + positive attitude. Not just skilled—also strengthens team culture and attracts other great people.

Kyndof actively recruits and retains A-tier talent; culture matters as much as skill.

### AX (Automation Transformation)
Beyond digital transformation—using AI to automate repetitive work.

**Five stages:**
1. Digitization (paper → digital)
2. Digitalization (connected data)
3. Digital Transformation (process redesign)
4. AI-Assistance (AI helps humans)
5. AI-Delegation (AI handles tasks autonomously)

**Goal:** 80%+ of repetitive work automated by AI.

### Assetization (자산화)
Turning one-off work into reusable assets that create lasting value.

**Examples:**
- Successful campaign → analysis report + reusable template
- Customer question → FAQ documentation + self-service guide
- Manual process → automated workflow

**Why this matters:** Every piece of work should leave something behind that makes future work easier.

**Assetization Checklist:**
- [ ] Documented for others to understand
- [ ] Turned into a repeatable process
- [ ] Data captured for future analysis
- [ ] Designed for reuse

## B

### Bottleneck
The slowest step in a process that limits overall throughput.

**Example:** If sample production takes 5 days while everything else takes 1 day, sample production is the bottleneck.

**Why this matters:** Fixing the bottleneck speeds up the entire workflow. Optimizing non-bottleneck steps wastes effort.

### Brilliant Jerk
Someone highly capable but toxic to team culture.

**Kyndof policy:** "No Brilliant Jerks"—we won't tolerate negative cultural impact regardless of individual skill.

### Buddy
Your assigned guide for your first two weeks. Ask them anything.

**Role:** Answer questions, help you navigate the company, have lunch together, make onboarding less overwhelming.

---

## C

### Circle
A business unit or team within Kyndof (e.g., 2000Archives, 2000Atelier, Corporate).

Each Circle can have its own subculture while aligning to company-wide principles (see Multi-Circle Culture).

### Compound Effect (복리 효과)
When value grows exponentially over time instead of linearly—like compound interest.

**Example:** Documenting a process saves 10 minutes today. Over 100 uses, it saves 1,000 minutes—and improves each time someone refines it.

**Real Kyndof example:** Our onboarding documentation started with one person's notes. After 20 new hires refined it, onboarding time dropped from 2 weeks to 3 days—an 80% reduction.

**Why this matters:** Early team members create systems that compound for years. This is the mathematical foundation of the [Snowball Principle](#snowball-principle).

## E

### Eisenhower Matrix (아이젠하워 매트릭스)
A method for prioritizing work by urgency and importance.

**The four quadrants:**
1. **Urgent + Important:** Do immediately (crisis, deadlines)
2. **Important + Not Urgent:** Schedule and plan (strategy, growth, skill-building)
3. **Urgent + Not Important:** Delegate (interruptions, some meetings)
4. **Not Urgent + Not Important:** Eliminate (time wasters, busy work)

**Why this matters:** Most people spend 80% of time in Quadrant 3 (urgent but unimportant). High performers focus on Quadrant 2 (important but not urgent)—this is where leverage and compound effects come from.

**How we use it:** During weekly planning, categorize your tasks into these quadrants. If you have zero Quadrant 2 tasks, you're in reactive mode, not strategic mode.

---

## H

### Hypothesis (가설)
An untested business assumption that needs validation through experimentation.

**Example:** "Adding vintage denim to our 2000Archives lineup will be popular with women in their 20s."

**How we test it:**
1. State the hypothesis clearly
2. Define success metrics (e.g., "30%+ sales increase in target demographic")
3. Run small-scale test (e.g., limited drop of 50 units)
4. Measure results against prediction
5. Learn and iterate

**Why this matters:** We test hypotheses with small experiments before big investments. Failed tests = learning, not failure. Every strategy should start with a testable hypothesis.

---

## I

### IMS (Integrated Management System)
Kyndof's Notion-based operating system for goals, tasks, KPIs, and decision-making.

**Core databases:** Goals, KPIs, Tasks, Projects, Decisions, Strategies, Positions, and more.

**Why this matters:** Everything is connected—your task links to a project, which links to a goal, which links to the company vision.

---

## K

### KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
A metric that measures success.

**Examples:** Monthly revenue, repeat purchase rate, delivery lead time, customer satisfaction score.

**Difference from KR:** KPIs are ongoing metrics. KRs are specific quarterly targets within OKRs.

### KR (Key Result)
The measurable outcomes in an OKR. Must be quantitative (has a number).

**Example OKR:**
- **Objective:** Improve customer satisfaction
- **KR1:** NPS score increases from 45 to 60
- **KR2:** Support response time under 4 hours
- **KR3:** Product return rate below 5%

---

## L

### Leverage
Getting big results from small effort.

**Example:** Writing one automation script saves 100 hours per year. That's leverage.

**Opposite:** Manual repetition every time (no leverage).

**Why this matters:** We optimize for leverage—systems and processes that multiply your impact.

---

## M

### Malik Method
A business framework by management scholar Fredmund Malik (22-Sheet Business Framework).

**How Kyndof uses it:** The IMS structure is inspired by Malik's integrated systems approach.

### Multi-Circle Culture (다원적 문화)
Kyndof doesn't force one culture on everyone. Each Circle (business unit) can have its own subculture as long as it aligns with core company principles.

**Example:**
- **2000Atelier:** Craft-focused, detail-obsessive, traditional fashion timelines (artisan mindset)
- **2000Archives:** Fast-paced, experimental, retail hustle (speed and testing mindset)

Both work under the same company values but express them differently.

**Why this matters:** We hire for culture *add*, not culture *fit*. Different teams need different working styles to succeed. Forcing uniformity would kill innovation.

See also: [Circle](#circle), [What We Believe](../../start-here/who-we-are/what-we-believe.md)

---

## O

### OKR (Objectives and Key Results)
A goal-setting framework.

- **Objective:** What you want to achieve (qualitative)
- **Key Results:** How you measure success (quantitative, 3-5 per objective)

**Example:**
- **Objective:** Establish 2000Archives as a leading K-fashion brand
- **KR1:** 1B won quarterly revenue
- **KR2:** 20% repeat purchase rate
- **KR3:** 3+ artist collaborations per quarter

**Why we use it:** Aligns everyone on what matters and how we measure progress.

---

## R

### RABSIC
Responsibility Assignment Matrix used for decision accountability. Defines who does what in every decision.

**Six roles:**
- **R (Responsible):** Does the work
- **A (Accountable):** Owns the outcome (only ONE per decision)
- **B (Backup):** Steps in if Responsible is unavailable
- **S (Support):** Helps the Responsible complete the work
- **I (Informed):** Gets notified after the decision
- **C (Consulted):** Provides input before the decision

See [RABSIC Framework](../../how-we-work/making-decisions/rabsic/) for detailed explanation.

---

## S

### Snowball Principle (눈덩이 원칙)
Kyndof's core philosophy: Small actions that compound over time create exponential value.

**The metaphor:** A single snowflake becomes a snowball when it rolls downhill—picking up more snow with each rotation. Eventually, it becomes unstoppable.

**At Kyndof:** We build systems that get stronger the longer they run. One person's documentation → helps ten people → they improve it → helps a hundred people → compounds forever.

**Key idea:** "We roll one snowball together"—not many isolated efforts, but one unified system that everyone strengthens.

**Opposite:** Volatile actions (휘발적 행동)—work that disappears after you do it, leaving no record or system behind.

**In practice:**
- Document what you learn
- Automate repetitive work
- Systematize successful processes
- Share knowledge openly
- Build for reuse

**Why this matters:** Your work should make future work easier. That's how small teams achieve exponential impact.

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
Step-by-step written instructions for repeatable processes.

**Examples:** Collaboration workflow SOP, shipping claims SOP, weekly reporting SOP.

**Why this matters:** Anyone can follow the SOP and get consistent results, even if the expert is unavailable.

---

## T

### Tasks DB
The Notion database where all work is tracked.

**Common statuses:** To Do → In Progress → Review → Done

**Why this matters:** Keeps everyone aligned on who's doing what and what's blocked.

---

## V

### Value Stream
The end-to-end flow of value from concept to customer.

**Example for 2000Archives:**
```
Market Trend → Product Concept → Design → Production →
Marketing → Sale → Fulfillment → Customer Satisfaction
```

**Why this matters:** A bottleneck anywhere stops the whole flow. You're not "done" until the customer receives value.

---

## Z

### Zero Factor (0인 팩터)
An element that makes the entire outcome zero (like multiplying by zero in mathematics).

**The formula:** `Outcome = Design × Production × Marketing × Delivery`

**Example:** If product design = 10/10, marketing = 10/10, but delivery = 0/10 (never ships), then: `10 × 10 × 10 × 0 = 0` — customer satisfaction = 0.

**More examples:**
- Amazing product + terrible customer service = customer won't return (lifetime value = 0)
- Perfect strategy + no execution = business impact = 0
- Great team + toxic culture = team falls apart (productivity = 0)

**Why this matters:** Identify and fix zero factors FIRST—they nullify all other efforts. Don't optimize non-zero factors until you've eliminated the zeros.

**How to find zero factors:**
1. Map your value stream end-to-end
2. Ask: "If this step completely fails, does everything fail?"
3. If yes → that's a potential zero factor
4. Measure: Is it currently performing at near-zero?
5. If yes → drop everything and fix it first

### 50-Point vs. 100-Point Performance
Kyndof's performance evaluation framework.

- **50 points:** Meet your goals (baseline expectation)
- **100 points:** Meet your goals + contribute to compound growth (documentation, process improvement, knowledge sharing)

**Why this matters:** We reward people who leave the company stronger for the next person.

---

## Numbers

### 50-Point vs. 100-Point Performance (50점/100점 평가)
Kyndof's performance evaluation framework.

- **50 points:** Meet your goals (baseline expectation—this is what you were hired to do)
- **100 points:** Meet your goals + contribute to compound growth

**What "compound contribution" means:**
- Document your work so others can learn from it
- Improve processes, not just follow them
- Share knowledge actively (training, mentoring, writing guides)
- Build systems that outlast your direct involvement

**Example:**
- 50-point: Complete assigned tasks on time
- 100-point: Complete tasks + create reusable template for similar tasks + train two teammates on the process

**Why this matters:** We reward people who leave the company stronger for the next person. Individual performance is expected; compounding impact earns recognition.
