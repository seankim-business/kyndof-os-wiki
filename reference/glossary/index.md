## ㄱ

### 가설 (Hypothesis)
**Definition:** An unverified business idea or assumption that needs testing.

**Example:** "We believe a vintage denim line will be popular with women in their 20s" is a hypothesis until we test it with actual customers.

**Related:** See decision-making documentation in [How We Work](../../how-we-work/making-decisions/)

---

## ㄴ

### 눈덩이 원칙 (Snowball Principle)
**Definition:** Kyndof's core philosophy - creating structures where small beginnings grow on their own over time.

**What it means:** Every action should either:
1. Build on what already exists (making it bigger)
2. Create reusable assets (starting a new snowball)

**Example:** Writing documentation for a process you just learned. Next person learns faster → teaches another person faster → knowledge compounds.

**Anti-pattern:** One-off actions that don't get recorded. The work evaporates when you're done.

**Core idea:** "We roll one snowball together" - everyone contributes to building something that grows.

---

## ㄷ

### 다원적 문화 (Multi-Circle Culture)
**Definition:** We don't force one company-wide culture. Different teams can have different cultures that fit their work.

**Example:**
- **2000Atelier:** Craftsmanship, deep focus, attention to detail
- **2000Archives:** Speed, experimentation, iteration

Both are valid. Neither is "more Kyndof" than the other.

---

## ㄹ

### 레버리지 (Leverage)
**Definition:** Points where small effort creates large results.

**Example:** Building an automation system. You invest 10 hours once, it saves 1 hour every day forever.

**Anti-pattern:** Doing the same manual task over and over without improving the process.

**Look for:** Repetitive work that could be automated, documented, or delegated.

---

## ㅁ

### Malik 방법론 (Malik Methodology)
**Definition:** Fredmund Malik's 22-Sheet Business Framework that forms the foundation of our IMS (Integrated Management System).

**Why it matters:** This framework is why our Notion workspace is structured the way it is - Goals connect to KPIs connect to Tasks in a specific way.

**For most people:** You don't need to study Malik deeply. Just know that there's a method behind how we organize business data.

---

## ㅂ

### 버디 (Buddy)
**Definition:** Your assigned guide during your first two weeks.

**What they do:**
- Answer "stupid questions" (there are none)
- Explain unwritten rules
- Have lunch with you
- Help you navigate your first days

**Your job:** Ask questions freely. That's why they're here.

### 복리 효과 (Compound Effect)
**Definition:** Value that grows exponentially over time, not linearly.

**Example:** Documentation doesn't just save time once. It:
- Saves time for every new person
- Which lets them contribute faster
- Which creates more documentation
- Which accelerates the next person even more

**Recognition:** At Kyndof, you get 100 points for work that creates compound effects, not just 50 points for completing tasks.

### 병목 (Bottleneck)
**Definition:** The slowest step in a process that limits everything else.

**Example:** Sample production takes 5 days → entire project timeline stretches 5 days, even if everything else is fast.

**Key principle:** Fix the bottleneck first. Speeding up other steps doesn't help.

**How to spot:** Look for where work piles up waiting.

---

## ㅅ

### 서클 (Circle)
**Definition:** A business unit or team within Kyndof. Each circle can have its own culture.

**Current circles:**
- **2000Archives**
- **2000Atelier**
- **Corporate**

**Why "circle":** Traditional hierarchies have top and bottom. Circles emphasize that each unit is complete on its own while being part of the whole.

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
**Pronunciation:** "에스오피" (S-O-P)

**Definition:** Step-by-step documentation of how to do a repetitive task, written so anyone can follow it.

**Example:** "Collaboration Workflow SOP" documents every step from initial contact to final delivery.

**Why it matters:** When someone is sick or leaves, work doesn't stop. Anyone can pick up the SOP and execute.

**Good SOP = Process survives people leaving**

---

## ㅇ

### 아이젠하워 매트릭스 (Eisenhower Matrix)
**Definition:** A method to prioritize work by urgency and importance.

**Four quadrants:**
1. **Urgent + Important:** Do immediately
2. **Important + Not Urgent:** Schedule and plan
3. **Urgent + Not Important:** Delegate
4. **Not Urgent + Not Important:** Delete

**Why Eisenhower:** President Eisenhower used this to manage decisions during WWII and presidency.

### 자산화 (Assetization)
**Definition:** Turning one-time work into reusable assets.

**Checklist for assetization:**
- ☑ Documented (others can use it)
- ☑ Processized (turned into repeatable SOP)
- ☑ Datafied (captured in structured format)
- ☑ Reusable (works for future situations)

**Example:** After a successful campaign:
- NOT assetized: "We did great! Move on to next one."
- Assetized: Analyze why it worked → document the approach → create template → next campaign uses the template

---

## ㅈ

### 0인 팩터 (Zero Factor)
**Definition:** An element that destroys the entire outcome if it fails. In multiplication, if one factor is zero, the result is zero.

**Example:** Product (9/10) × Design (9/10) × Delivery (0/10) = **Total customer satisfaction: 0**

**Management principle:** Identify zero factors first and fix them before optimizing anything else.

**How to find:** Look for "if this fails, everything fails" components.

---

## A-Z

### A급 인재 (A-Player)
**Definition:** Someone with both high capability AND positive attitude.

**Characteristics:**
- Strong individual performance
- Contributes to team culture
- Attracts other A-players

**Kyndof standard:** We want A-players who lift everyone around them, not brilliant jerks who perform alone.

### AX (Automation Transformation)
**Definition:** Going beyond digital transformation (DX) to AI-based automation.

**Five stages:**
1. Digitization (paper → digital)
2. Digitalization (digital workflows)
3. Digital Transformation (business model changes)
4. AI-Assistance (AI helps humans)
5. AI-Delegation (AI handles tasks autonomously)

**Kyndof goal:** Automate 80% of repetitive work with AI.

### Brilliant Jerk
**Definition:** Someone who is extremely talented but toxic to team culture.

**Kyndof policy:** "No Brilliant Jerks" - we don't tolerate this, no matter how good you are.

**Why:** One brilliant jerk drives away 3-5 A-players. Net negative for the company.

---

## I-M

### IMS (Integrated Management System)
**Definition:** Kyndof's Notion-based management system. Everything connects: Goals → KPIs → Strategies → Tasks.

**Core databases:**
- Goals
- KPIs
- Strategies
- Tasks
- Projects
- Decisions
- (and 8 more)

**Why it matters:** This is how we make sure strategic goals actually connect to daily work.

---

## K-O

### KPI / KR / OKR
**KPI (Key Performance Indicator):** Metrics that measure success. Examples: monthly revenue, repurchase rate, delivery lead time.

**KR (Key Result):** Measurable outcomes in OKR framework. Must be quantifiable.

**OKR (Objectives and Key Results):** Goal-setting framework.
- Objective = what you want to achieve (qualitative)
- Key Results = how you measure it (quantitative)

**Example:**
- Objective: "Become the best vintage fashion brand in Korea"
- KR1: Reach 10,000 monthly active customers
- KR2: Achieve 40% repurchase rate
- KR3: Get 4.5+ average review rating

---

## T-V

### Tasks DB
**Definition:** The Notion database where all tasks are tracked.

**States:**
- ToDo → InProgress → Review → Done

**Why it matters:** This is the source of truth for "what needs to be done." If it's not in Tasks DB, it doesn't exist.

### Value Stream
**Definition:** The entire flow of how we create and deliver value to customers.

**Example flow:**
Planning → Design → Production → Marketing → Delivery → Customer Service → Customer

**Management principle:** Look at the whole stream, not individual steps. Find bottlenecks across the entire flow.

---

## 50-100

### 50점/100점 평가 (50/100 Evaluation)
**Definition:** Kyndof's performance evaluation standard.

**50 points:** You achieved the goal (did what you were supposed to do).

**100 points:** You achieved the goal AND contributed to compound growth (made next time better).

**Examples:**

| Task | 50 points | 100 points |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Run campaign | Campaign completed | Campaign completed + documented learnings + created template |
| Fix bug | Bug fixed | Bug fixed + added test + documented root cause |
| Ship product | Product shipped | Product shipped + improved shipping process |

**Key insight:** 100 points = you made the snowball bigger, not just rolled it once.
