# Company Policies

**Navigation:** [Reference](../index.md) > **Policies**

Company policies exist to keep things fair, consistent, and transparent. They're not bureaucracy for its own sake - they're the guardrails that let everyone move fast with confidence.

## Why Policies Matter

When everyone knows the rules:
- **Decisions are faster.** You don't need to ask "is this okay?" every time.
- **Fairness is built-in.** The same rules apply to everyone, regardless of role.
- **Edge cases are handled.** When something unusual happens, there's a reference point.

If a policy doesn't make sense or creates friction, that's feedback. Let us know.

## When in Doubt

If a situation isn't covered by a policy:
1. Check with your team lead
2. If it involves money, check with Finance Lead
3. If it involves people, check with Operations Lead
4. When unclear, ask CEO Staff

Better to ask first than apologize later.
