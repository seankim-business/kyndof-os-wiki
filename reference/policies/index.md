# Company Policies

Formal policies that govern how Kyndof operates.

## What Are Policies?

Policies are the rules we all follow. Unlike SOPs (which tell you *how* to do something), policies tell you *what you can and cannot do*.

## Why Policies Exist

Good policies protect everyone:
- They set clear boundaries so you don't have to guess
- They ensure fairness (same rules for everyone)
- They help us comply with laws and regulations
- They prevent problems before they happen

## Current Policies

**[Corporate Card Usage](./corporate-card.md)** - Rules for using company credit cards, spending limits, approval requirements, and expense reporting.

**[Expense Policy](./expense-policy.md)** - Guidelines for business expenses, payment methods, and accounting procedures.

## How to Use Policies

**Before you do something involving company money or resources:** Check if there's a policy for it.

**If you're not sure:** Ask in Slack **#help** or ask your team lead. It's always better to ask than to accidentally break a rule.

**If a policy doesn't make sense:** Policies can be changed. Talk to your team lead about why it's a problem and what should change.

## Policy Violations

**Unintentional violations:** If you accidentally break a policy, report it immediately. Mistakes happen. We'll fix it together.

**Repeated violations:** If the same issue happens multiple times, we'll work with you to understand why and prevent it.

**Deliberate violations:** Intentionally breaking policies is a serious issue and may result in disciplinary action.
