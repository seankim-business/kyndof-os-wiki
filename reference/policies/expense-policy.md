# Expense Policy

Guidelines for business expenses and payment methods.

## Purpose

This policy clarifies how different types of expenses should be paid and documented to maintain clean accounting records.

---

## Payment Methods by Expense Type

### Manufacturing-Related Expenses

**Payment method:** Bank transfer from Kookmin Bank (국민은행)

**Who processes:**승연 (Seung-yeon)

**Includes:**
- Packaging costs (포장비)
- Goods production costs (굿즈제작비)
- Labor costs (공임비)
- All manufacturing-related expenses

**Why this matters:** Manufacturing costs are managed by the Design Team and need separate tracking for accurate cost accounting.

### General Business Expenses

**Payment method:** Bank transfer from Hana Bank (하나은행)

**Who processes:** 다은 (Da-eun)

**Includes:**
- Everything NOT related to manufacturing
- General operating expenses
- Administrative costs
- Most other business expenses

---

## Credit Card Guidelines

### Use Personal-Name Cards When Possible

**New policy (effective 2024-07-18):** Use your individual corporate card (기명 카드) instead of shared company cards whenever possible.

**Why:** Makes it easier to track who spent what and for which project.

**Common situations:**
- Quick delivery services (퀵)
- Small purchases
- Routine business expenses

### After Using Your Card

**1. Categorize the expense type:**
- Is it delivery cost (운반비/퀵비) or taxi fare (택시비)?
- Be specific - don't just write "transportation"

**2. Tag the project:**
- In the "granter" tag field, indicate which project this expense belongs to
- This helps accounting track costs by project

**Why this is important:** Accounting staff cannot know after the fact which project an expense belongs to. Only you, the person who made the purchase, know the context. Proper tagging saves hours of follow-up questions.

---

## Expense Categories

### Delivery & Transportation

**Delivery costs (운반비/퀵비):**
- Quick delivery services
- Courier services
- Freight charges

**Taxi/ride costs (택시비):**
- Business travel taxis
- Ride-sharing for business purposes

**IMPORTANT:** These are different accounting categories. Always specify which one.

### Manufacturing Costs

All costs related to making products:
- Raw materials
- Production labor
- Packaging
- Manufacturing supplies

**Track separately** because these go into Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

---

## Documentation Requirements

### For All Expenses

**Required information:**
1. Date of expense
2. Vendor name
3. Amount
4. Business purpose
5. Project or cost center
6. Receipt with vendor business registration number (if required by tax law)

### For Credit Card Expenses

**Additional requirements:**
1. Expense category (delivery, taxi, meals, etc.)
2. Project tag (which project/initiative)
3. If split among multiple people, note who attended

See [Corporate Card Policy](./corporate-card.md) for detailed card usage rules.

---

## Why These Rules Exist

### Clean Accounting Records
- Proper categorization ensures accurate financial statements
- Project tagging enables cost tracking per initiative
- Separate manufacturing costs show true product margins

### Tax Compliance
- Different expense types have different tax treatments
- Business registration numbers are required for most expenses
- Proper documentation protects the company in audits

### Budget Management
- Project tagging shows which initiatives are over/under budget
- Department tracking prevents budget overruns
- Helps plan future budgets based on actual costs

---

## Special Situations

### Split Expenses
If multiple people share a business expense:
- One person pays
- Note all attendees in expense report
- Tag the appropriate project/department

### Advance Payments
Manufacturing vendors sometimes require advance payment:
- Get approval from Finance Lead first
- Document the payment terms
- Track the advance payment separately until goods/services are delivered

### Reimbursements
If you paid with personal money:
1. Submit expense report with receipt
2. Note that this is a reimbursement request
3. Include all required documentation
4. Finance Team will process payment to you

---

## Approval Requirements

### Requires CEO Approval
- Expenses outside normal categories
- Expenses exceeding your budget limit
- Unusual payment terms
- First-time vendor relationships

### Requires Finance Lead Approval
- Budget category changes
- Manufacturing vs. general expense reclassification
- Unusual expense timing or amounts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Wrong:** "Used card for business expense" (too vague)
**✓ Right:** "Quick delivery for fabric samples - Project Vintage Denim 2024-Q2"

**❌ Wrong:** Submitting receipt without project tag
**✓ Right:** Receipt + project tag + expense category

**❌ Wrong:** Paying manufacturing cost from general account
**✓ Right:** Check expense type → use correct bank account → proper tracking

---

## FAQ

**Q: I forgot to tag the project. Can I add it later?**
A: Yes, but do it as soon as possible. Contact Finance Team to update.

**Q: What if I don't know which project to tag?**
A: Ask your team lead or manager. If truly unclear, tag your department and note "general operations."

**Q: Can I use shared company cards instead of my personal-name card?**
A: Only if your personal card isn't available or for very large purchases. Prefer personal-name cards when possible.

**Q: What if the vendor doesn't have a business registration number?**
A: Some small vendors are sole proprietors without registration. Document this and get manager approval for the expense.

**Q: How do I know if something is manufacturing-related?**
A: If it goes into making a physical product (materials, labor, packaging), it's manufacturing. If unsure, ask Design Team or Finance.
