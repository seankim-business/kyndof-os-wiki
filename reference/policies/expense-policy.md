# Expense & Reimbursement Policy

**Navigation:** [Reference](../index.md) > [Policies](./index.md) > **Expense Policy**

This guide covers how expenses are processed, who handles what, and how to get reimbursed for legitimate business costs.

---

## Two Types of Expenses

### Corporate Card Expenses
Purchases made on company-issued cards. See [Corporate Card Usage](./corporate-card.md) for details.

### Out-of-Pocket Expenses
When you pay personally for a business expense and need reimbursement.

---

## Expense Categories

Understanding which category your expense falls into helps Finance process it correctly:

### Manufacturing Costs
Production-related expenses: packaging, materials, sample making, manufacturing fees.
- **Managed by:** Design Team
- **Payment:** Kookmin Bank account
- **Contact:** Design Lead

### General Operations
Everything else: office supplies, software, travel, meals.
- **Managed by:** Finance Team
- **Payment:** Hana Bank account
- **Contact:** Finance Lead

## How to Request Reimbursement

### Step 1: Pay with Personal Card (when required)
Use your personal registered card when possible, especially for:
- Courier services (quickservice delivery)
- Small urgent purchases
- When corporate card isn't available

### Step 2: Tag the Project
After payment in GoWid:
- Go to the "granter" tag field
- Tag which project this expense belongs to
- This is critical for accounting - Finance can't retroactively determine which project an expense belongs to

### Step 3: Categorize Correctly
Be specific about expense type:
- **Transportation (Courier)** vs **Taxi** - these are tracked separately
- **Office supplies** vs **Project materials**
- **Team meal** vs **Client entertainment**

## Approval Workflow

| Amount | Approval Required |
|--------|-------------------|
| Under approval threshold | Team Lead |
| Standard expenses | Finance Lead review |
| Large or unusual | CEO approval |

When in doubt about whether something needs pre-approval, ask first. It's faster than getting rejected after.

## Reimbursement Timeline

- **Submission deadline:** End of each month
- **Processing time:** Within 2 weeks of submission
- **Payment:** Direct deposit to registered bank account

Late submissions may be delayed to next cycle.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Missing project tags:** Finance can't allocate costs without knowing which project they belong to.

**Wrong expense type:** "Transportation" could mean courier, taxi, or personal vehicle. Be specific.

**No receipt:** Digital or physical, you need proof of purchase.

**Vague descriptions:** "Meeting expense" tells us nothing. "Client lunch with Brand X to discuss sample review" tells us everything.

## Getting Help

**Questions about categorization:** Ask Finance Team in Slack
**Questions about project allocation:** Ask your Team Lead
