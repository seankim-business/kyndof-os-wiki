# Organizational Culture Policy

**Navigation:** [Reference](../index.md) > [Policies](./index.md) > **Organizational Culture**

Kyndof builds its culture on trust, transparency, and professionalism. This document outlines our non-negotiable standards for how we treat each other and the company.

---

## Two Core Principles

These principles are non-negotiable. Violations result in immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

### 1. Confidentiality

**Do not share:**
- Your salary or compensation details with colleagues
- Other people's employment terms or contract conditions
- Internal company information with external parties
- Confidential business strategies or decisions

This applies to casual conversations, social media, and conversations with friends or family. If someone asks about internal matters, redirect them to official channels.

### 2. No Backbiting

**Zero tolerance for gossip and negative talk about colleagues or the company.**

We define backbiting as:
- Sharing complaints about colleagues with other colleagues instead of addressing them directly
- Spreading negative opinions about team members, leadership, or company decisions
- Creating or participating in side conversations that undermine trust

This includes being a passive participant. If you're present when backbiting occurs and don't redirect the conversation, you're part of the problem.

## Why These Rules Exist

Backbiting feels like venting, but it actually:
- **Erodes trust.** If you talk about others behind their back, people assume you do the same to them.
- **Prevents problem-solving.** Problems that stay in hallways never get fixed.
- **Creates factions.** "Us vs. them" dynamics damage collaboration.
- **Hurts people.** Words travel. The person you're talking about will eventually hear.

We're not asking you to pretend everything is perfect. We're asking you to address problems through proper channels where they can actually be solved.

## How to Handle Difficult Situations

### If You Have a Problem with a Colleague

1. **Talk to them directly.** Most issues resolve with honest, private conversation.
2. **If that doesn't work,** escalate to your team lead or their team lead.
3. **For serious issues,** go to Operations Lead or CEO Staff.

### If You Witness Backbiting

**Redirect the conversation:**
- "Have you talked to [person] about this directly?"
- "Maybe we should bring this up in a team meeting?"
- "I'm not comfortable discussing this without [person] here."

**If it continues,** report it to your team lead or Operations Lead.

### If Someone Vents to You

It's natural to need to express frustration. The line is:
- **Okay:** "I'm frustrated about a situation and need advice on how to handle it."
- **Not okay:** "Did you hear what [person] did? Can you believe it?"

Help people find constructive paths forward.

## What Happens When Rules Are Broken

**First incident:** Private conversation with your manager about expectations.

**Pattern of behavior:** Formal warning and documented discussion with leadership.

**Serious or repeated violations:** Termination of employment.

We don't have a three-strikes policy for these principles because they're foundational to our culture. A single serious breach can warrant immediate action.

---

## The Culture We're Building

We want Kyndof to be a place where:
- **Problems get solved.** Issues surface quickly because people feel safe raising them.
- **Feedback flows freely.** You can tell someone their work needs improvement without it becoming personal drama.
- **Trust is default.** You assume good intent from colleagues until proven otherwise.
- **Growth happens.** We acknowledge we're not perfect and work openly to improve.

This only works if everyone commits to the same standards.

## Getting Help

**Having a workplace concern?** Talk to your team lead, Operations Lead, or CEO Staff.

**Unsure if something is appropriate?** Ask. We'd rather have the conversation before something goes wrong.

**Feeling uncomfortable about something you witnessed?** Report it. Anonymously if needed.
