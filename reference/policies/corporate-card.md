# Corporate Card Usage

**Navigation:** [Reference](../index.md) > [Policies](./index.md) > **Corporate Card**

Your corporate card is a tool for getting work done, not a personal expense account. Here's how to use it responsibly.

---

## What You Can Use It For

Corporate cards are issued for business expenses only. Approved categories include:

- **Meals & Entertainment:** Team lunches, client dinners, business events
- **Office Supplies:** Small office needs, work materials
- **Transportation:** Business travel, taxis for work purposes
- **Subscriptions:** Work-related software and services (with approval)

Your monthly limit is set based on your role and typical expenses. If you need more for a specific project, request a temporary increase from Finance Lead before spending.

---

## What You Cannot Use It For

The following are strictly prohibited:

- **Personal purchases** of any kind
- **Weekend/holiday spending** without documented business purpose
- **Split transactions** (breaking up purchases to stay under limits)
- **Cash-equivalent items** (gift cards, easily resold goods)
- **Luxury items** unrelated to business needs
- **Pre-payments** to vendors without approval

If you're unsure about a purchase, ask first. It's faster than explaining after.

## How to Submit Expenses

Every purchase requires documentation. No exceptions.

### Step 1: Keep Your Receipt
Save every receipt. Physical or digital. Include the vendor's business registration number when visible.

### Step 2: Submit via GoWid

**Mobile (GoWid App):**
1. Open GoWid app
2. Tap settings (three lines) in the top right
3. Select "Unsubmitted Items"
4. Select each transaction
5. Fill in: Purpose, Attendees (if meal), Memo with clear description
6. Attach receipt photo
7. Submit

**Desktop (gowid.com):**
1. Log in to gowid.com
2. Click "Card Management" in top right
3. Click "Usage History Management" on left sidebar
4. Select the transaction
5. Fill in all required fields
6. Submit

### Step 3: Submit Physical Receipts
At month end, submit all physical receipts to Finance Team's designated reviewer.

## What Makes a Good Expense Submission

**Clear purpose:** "Client lunch with [company name] to discuss Q2 partnership" not "food"

**Complete attendees:** For meals, list everyone present

**Business context:** Why was this expense necessary for work?

**Proper categorization:** Match the expense type to what actually happened

---

## What Gets Rejected

Finance Team reviews all submissions. You'll be asked to resubmit if:

- Receipt is missing or unreadable
- Purpose is vague or missing
- Business justification isn't clear
- Expense doesn't match your card's approved categories

If you can't provide proper documentation after being asked, it counts as one misuse incident.

---

## Consequences of Misuse

We take card responsibility seriously:

**First offense:** Warning and required resubmission
**Pattern of issues:** Card privileges reviewed
**Serious violations:** Immediate escalation to leadership

When in doubt, ask before you spend. Finance Team is here to help, not to punish.

---

## Special Situations

### Weekend or Holiday Spending
If you must use the card on a weekend or holiday, document the business reason thoroughly. "Meeting with partner who was only available Saturday" is acceptable. "Dinner" is not.

### Client Entertainment
For clients or external partners, the same rules apply. Keep it professional and proportional to the business relationship.

### Travel
For business trips, coordinate with Finance Lead before departure. Know your daily limits and documentation requirements.
