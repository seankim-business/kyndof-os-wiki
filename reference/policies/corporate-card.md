# Corporate Card Usage Policy

Rules for using company credit cards.

## Who This Applies To

Anyone with a company-issued credit card (corporate card or personal-name corporate card).

## Why This Policy Exists

Corporate cards are company money, not personal money. This policy ensures:
- Expenses are legitimate business expenses
- Proper documentation for accounting and taxes
- Fair and consistent spending across the company

---

## Monthly Spending Limits

Your monthly spending limit depends on your role and is set by the CEO, Finance Lead, and Operations Lead based on your job requirements.

**If you need to exceed your limit:** Get approval from CEO and Finance Lead BEFORE making the purchase.

**If you need to use your budget for a different category:** Get approval from CEO and Finance Lead BEFORE spending.

---

## What You Can Use It For

Corporate cards are for legitimate business expenses in these categories:

### 1. Business Meals & Entertainment (접대비)
- Client meetings
- Partner dinners
- Business development meals

### 2. Employee Welfare (복리후생비)
- Team meals
- Team building activities
- Employee benefits

### 3. Small Supplies (소액 소모품비)
- Office supplies under a certain amount
- Small equipment or tools

### 4. Other Categories
- Travel expenses
- Software subscriptions
- Professional services
- Materials and supplies

**General rule:** If the expense requires a tax invoice (세금계산서), get a tax invoice instead of using the card - EXCEPT for the three categories above (meals, welfare, small supplies).

**Not listed here?** Get CEO approval BEFORE spending.

## Prohibited Uses

You CANNOT use the corporate card for:

### Automatic Restrictions
1. **Weekend or holiday purchases** - Unless it's clearly work-related. If you must, write a detailed explanation of the business purpose.
2. **Multiple split transactions at one vendor** - Don't split a large purchase into smaller ones to avoid limits.
3. **Easily cashable items** - Things that can be easily converted to cash (gift cards, etc.).
4. **Luxury items** - Purchases that are clearly extravagant or personal.
5. **Unrelated businesses** - Places that have no reasonable connection to work.
6. **Advance payments to vendors** - Unless this is normal practice for that vendor.
7. **Expenses for other departments** - Use your own department's budget.
8. **Anti-Corruption Law violations** - No gifts/meals over 30,000 KRW for public officials, journalists, or media.

### Exception Process
If you have a legitimate reason to make a restricted purchase, get CEO approval FIRST.
