# SOP Standards & Guidelines

Documentation and guidelines for creating, maintaining, and reviewing SOPs.

## Available Standards

### [SOP Writing Guide](./sop-writing-guide/)
Comprehensive guide to writing high-quality, actionable SOPs. Covers structure, style, testing, and maintenance.

**Use this when:**
- Creating a new SOP from scratch
- Reviewing/improving an existing SOP
- Training new SOP authors

---

### Numbering Convention
SOP ID assignment rules and ranges.

| Range | Department | Category |
|-------|------------|----------|
| 001-099 | 2000atelier | Design (001-009), Pattern (010-019), Production (020-029) |
| 100-199 | Brand Ops | Sales (100-109), Marketing (110-119) |
| 200-299 | Corp Ops | HR (200-209), Finance (210-219), Admin (220-229) |
| 300-399 | Reserved | Future expansion |

**Rules:**
- Never reuse retired SOP IDs
- When range full, expand to next hundred (e.g., 001-199 → 001-299)
- Cross-departmental processes use 900+ range

---

### Review Process
Annual and triggered review requirements.

**Annual Review Cycle:**
- Q1: Corp Ops SOPs (HR, Finance)
- Q2: Brand Ops SOPs (Sales, Marketing)
- Q3: 2000atelier SOPs (Design, Pattern)
- Q4: 2000atelier SOPs (Production, QA)

**Triggered Reviews:**
- Process failure (SOP led to error)
- Major system change (new software, equipment)
- Org restructure (new roles, departments)
- Repeated questions (unclear section)

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Process still current (no outdated steps)
- [ ] Tools/systems accurate (software hasn't changed)
- [ ] Roles correct (org structure current)
- [ ] Metrics relevant (targets adjusted)
- [ ] Quality gates realistic (achievable standards)

| **Active** | Approved and in use | Execute process per SOP |
| **Revised** | Updates in progress | Complete revisions, re-review |
| **Archived** | Superseded or deprecated | Reference only, do not execute |
