# Standard Operating Procedures Library

Welcome to the Kyndof SOP Library. This central repository contains all documented standard operating procedures across the organization, organized for easy discovery and reference.

## Purpose

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) ensure:
- Consistent quality across all operations
- Clear accountability and role definitions (RABSIC framework)
- Efficient onboarding and training
- Compliance with industry standards
- Continuous improvement through documented processes

## Organization

SOPs are organized in two complementary ways:

### By Department
Navigate by organizational unit to find procedures owned by specific teams:
- **2000atelier** - Design, pattern-making, and production procedures
- **Brand Ops** - Sales, marketing, and customer engagement
- **Corp Ops** - HR, finance, and administrative procedures

### By Process
Navigate by end-to-end workflows that span multiple departments:
- **Order to Delivery** - Complete customer fulfillment process
- **Hiring** - Recruitment through onboarding
- **Content Creation** - Concept through publication

## SOP Numbering Convention

| Range | Department | Category |
|-------|------------|----------|
| 001-099 | 2000atelier | Design, Pattern, Production |
| 100-199 | Brand Ops | Sales, Marketing |
| 200-299 | Corp Ops | HR, Finance, Admin |
