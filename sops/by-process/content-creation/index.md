## Critical Handoff Points

### Handoff 1: Marketing → 2000atelier (Photoshoot)
**Trigger:** Content requires on-model photography of custom pieces

**Required Information:**
- Photoshoot creative brief
- Garment requirements (which pieces to photograph)
- Styling direction
- Timeline and deadline

**Common Issues:**
- Garments not ready for photoshoot date
- Styling vision doesn't match garment aesthetic

**Mitigation:** Coordinate photoshoot scheduling with production timeline; involve Designer in photoshoot planning

---

### Handoff 2: Content Creator → Marketing Manager (Review)
**Trigger:** Content draft complete

**Required Information:**
- Draft content (text, images, video)
- Platform specifications met (dimensions, format, length)
- Caption/copy with hashtags (if social)

**Common Issues:**
- Content doesn't match creative brief
- Technical specs incorrect (wrong dimensions, file format)

**Mitigation:** Use creative brief template with clear specifications; provide examples of approved content

---

## Content Calendar

Content is planned monthly with weekly execution windows:

**Monthly Planning Cycle:**
1. Week 4 of previous month: Plan next month's calendar
2. Week 1: Execute Week 1-2 content
3. Week 2: Execute Week 2-3 content
4. Week 3: Execute Week 3-4 content
