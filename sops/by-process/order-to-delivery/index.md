## Total Cycle Time

| Complexity | Typical Duration | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| **Simple** (single costume, straightforward design) | 4-5 weeks | Minimal revisions, standard materials |
| **Moderate** (multiple pieces, some complexity) | 6-7 weeks | 1 round of revisions, specialty fabrics |
| **Complex** (intricate design, large production) | 8-12 weeks | Multiple fittings, experimental techniques |

## Critical Handoff Points

### Handoff 1: Sales → Design
**Trigger:** Contract signed + deposit received

**Required Information:**
- Signed contract
- Approved quote with scope details
- Client contact information
- Payment confirmation

**Owner:** Sales Rep hands off to Design Coordinator

**Common Issues:**
- Incomplete client information (delays intake)
- Unrealistic timeline expectations set by Sales
- Budget vs. scope mismatch

**Mitigation:** Sales uses [SOP-100](/wiki/sops/by-department/brand-ops/sales/sop-100-client-inquiry.html) qualification process thoroughly

---

### Handoff 2: Design → Pattern
**Trigger:** Client approves design concepts

**Required Information:**
- Approved design sketches
- Material specifications
- Size/measurement requirements
- Construction notes

**Owner:** Designer hands off to Pattern Team Lead

**Common Issues:**
- Ambiguous construction details (pattern interpretation errors)
- Missing measurements or size information
- Material availability not confirmed

**Mitigation:** Design brief ([SOP-001](/wiki/sops/by-department/2000atelier/design/sop-001-design-brief-intake.html)) includes complete technical specifications

---

### Handoff 3: Pattern → Production
**Trigger:** Pattern completed and approved

**Required Information:**
- Complete pattern pieces with markings
- Fabric requirements and sourcing
- Construction sequence notes
- Special technique instructions

**Owner:** Pattern Maker hands off to Production Manager

**Common Issues:**
- Fabric not ordered in advance (production delays)
- Pattern pieces missing notches or markings
- Special techniques not documented

**Mitigation:** Production Manager reviews pattern and fabric status before accepting handoff

---

## Common Delays & Mitigation

| Delay Cause | Typical Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Client slow to approve designs | +3-7 days | Set approval deadline in contract; follow-up sequence |
| Fabric out of stock | +5-10 days | Verify material availability BEFORE quote send |
| Pattern fit issues requiring revision | +3-5 days | Schedule fitting session for complex projects |
| Rush orders displacing current work | Variable | Charge rush fee (+50%); communicate delays to affected clients |
| Scope creep (client adds requirements) | +2-7 days | Use change order process; client approves timeline/budget impact |

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Criteria | Responsible | Consequence of Failure |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Contract Approval** | Signed contract + deposit received | Sales Manager | Project does not start |
| **Design Approval** | Client written approval of sketches | Creative Director | Pattern work cannot begin |
| **Pattern Approval** | Technical review passed | Pattern Team Lead | Cutting cannot begin |
| **Cutting Quality** | Grain alignment, no flaws, complete pieces | Production Manager | Re-cut required (timeline delay) |
| **Sewing Quality** | Seam quality, construction accuracy | Sewing Team Lead | Rework required (timeline delay) |
| **Final QA** | Zero defects, all specs met | QA Inspector | Cannot deliver; rework or remake |

## Process Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| On-Time Delivery Rate | ≥90% | TBD | Projects delivered by promised date / total projects |
| Cycle Time (Simple Projects) | ≤30 days | TBD | Contract date → delivery date |
| Revision Rate | ≤30% | TBD | Projects requiring design revisions / total projects |
| QA Pass Rate (First Inspection) | ≥95% | TBD | Projects passing QA on first inspection / total projects |
| Client Satisfaction (Post-Delivery) | ≥4.5/5.0 | TBD | Average rating from post-delivery survey |

## Continuous Improvement

**Monthly Review:**
- Production Manager and Sales Manager review metrics
- Identify top 3 delays from past month
- Implement mitigation strategies
- Update relevant SOPs if process changes

**Quarterly Optimization:**
- Full process walkthrough with all stakeholders
- Identify handoff friction points
- Streamline communication channels
- Update cycle time targets based on actual performance
