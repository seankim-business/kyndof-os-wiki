   - Web form submissions (auto-notification to Slack #sales channel)
   - Phone voicemail (check every 2 hours)
   - Social media DMs (Instagram, LinkedIn - check twice daily)

2. Upon receiving inquiry, immediately log in CRM:

4. Quick triage assessment:
   - **IF** inquiry is urgent (event <14 days) → Flag as "High Priority", notify Sales Manager immediately
   - **IF** inquiry is clearly out of scope (e.g., requesting services we don't offer) → Route to Step 2 with "Likely Decline" tag

### Step 2: Initial Response & Information Gathering

**Objective:** Respond within 4 business hours with professional acknowledgment and request for additional details.

**Actions:**
1. Prepare personalized response email using template (see Appendix A):

   **Template Selection:**
   - Standard custom costume inquiry → Template A1
   - Production/bulk order inquiry → Template A2
   - Event/deadline-driven inquiry → Template A3
   - Out-of-scope inquiry → Template A4 (decline with referral)

2. Customize template with specific details:
   - Address prospect by name
   - Reference specific details from their inquiry (shows attentiveness)
   - If inquiry includes images/sketches, acknowledge and compliment vision
   - Include relevant portfolio example (1-2 projects similar to their request)

3. Request additional information needed for quoting:
   - **For Custom Costume Inquiries:**
     - Event/usage context and date
     - Quantity needed (single piece or multiple)
     - Size information (measurements or size chart)
     - Budget range (helps set realistic expectations)
     - Style references or inspiration images
     - Specific must-have features or materials

   - **For Production Orders:**
     - Quantity and size breakdown
     - Deadline for delivery
     - Budget per piece and total budget
     - Tech pack or detailed specifications (if available)
     - Quality expectations and reference samples

4. Set clear expectations for next steps:
   - "Once I receive these details, I'll prepare a preliminary quote within 2 business days."
   - "For complex projects, I may schedule a 30-minute consultation call to ensure we fully understand your vision."
   - Include calendar scheduling link for consultation (Calendly or similar)

5. Send email and update CRM:
   - **Subject line format:** "Re: [Original Subject] - Kyndof Custom Costumes"
   - CC sales@kyndof.com for tracking
   - Update CRM status: "Contacted - Awaiting Response"
   - Log email sent timestamp
   - Set follow-up reminder: 3 business days if no response

**Decision Point:**
- **IF** inquiry is clearly out of scope → Send decline email with referrals (Template A4), update status to "Declined - Out of Scope", END process
- **IF** inquiry is rush (<7 days) → CC Sales Manager on response, flag for immediate Creative Director review
- **ELSE** → Proceed to Step 3 when prospect responds

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Response sent within 4 business hours
- [ ] Email personalized (not generic template)
- [ ] Relevant portfolio example included
- [ ] Clear information requests listed
- [ ] Next steps communicated

- [ ] Follow-up reminder set (3 days)

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Responsible Role:** Sales Representative

---

### Step 3: Detailed Qualification & Needs Assessment

**Objective:** Determine project fit and gather complete information for quoting.

**Actions:**
1. Review prospect's response to information request:
   - Check if all requested information provided
   - **IF** information incomplete → Send follow-up request for missing details
   - **IF** information complete → Proceed with qualification

2. Apply BANT qualification framework:

   **B - Budget:**
   - Is stated budget realistic for scope?
   - **Green Flag:** Budget ≥ typical project range for request type
   - **Yellow Flag:** Budget 75-99% of typical range (may require scope reduction)
   - **Red Flag:** Budget <75% of typical range (likely not qualified)

   **A - Authority:**
   - Is contact the decision-maker?
   - **Green Flag:** Contact is client/producer/decision-maker
   - **Yellow Flag:** Contact is coordinator/assistant but has access to decision-maker
   - **Red Flag:** Contact has no decision-making authority or access

   **N - Need:**
   - Is there genuine need for custom work?
   - **Green Flag:** Unique design, specific event, character costume, production requirement
   - **Yellow Flag:** Could potentially use stock items but prefers custom
   - **Red Flag:** Stock items would serve need; client unaware of options

   **T - Timeline:**
   - Is timeline realistic for custom production?
   - **Green Flag:** >4 weeks to deadline (standard custom timeline)
   - **Yellow Flag:** 2-4 weeks to deadline (possible with rush fee)
   - **Red Flag:** <2 weeks to deadline (unlikely to meet need)

3. Calculate qualification score:
   - **4 Green Flags:** Highly Qualified → Proceed to quoting
   - **3 Green, 1 Yellow:** Qualified → Proceed to quoting with noted considerations
   - **2 or fewer Green:** Questionable Fit → Consult Sales Manager before proceeding
   - **2+ Red Flags:** Not Qualified → Politely decline with alternatives

4. For qualified leads, determine project complexity:
   - **Simple:** Single costume, straightforward design, standard materials, ample timeline
     - Sales Rep can quote directly (proceed to Step 4)

   - **Moderate:** Multiple pieces, some design complexity, specialty materials, standard timeline
     - Sales Rep prepares quote with Creative Director review (proceed to Step 4)

   - **Complex:** Large production run, highly intricate design, experimental techniques, tight timeline
     - Schedule consultation call with Creative Director (proceed to Step 3B)

5. Update CRM with qualification results:
   - Qualification score: [Highly Qualified / Qualified / Questionable / Not Qualified]
   - BANT assessment notes
   - Project complexity: [Simple / Moderate / Complex]
   - Next action: [Quote directly / Creative Director review / Consultation call / Decline]

**Decision Point:**
- **IF** Highly Qualified + Simple/Moderate → Proceed to Step 4 (direct quoting)
- **IF** Highly Qualified + Complex → Proceed to Step 3B (consultation call)
- **IF** Qualified with Yellow Flags → Consult Sales Manager, then proceed per manager direction
- **IF** Not Qualified → Send decline email with alternatives, END process

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] All information requests fulfilled
- [ ] BANT framework applied (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline assessed)
- [ ] Qualification score calculated
- [ ] Project complexity determined
- [ ] CRM updated with qualification results
- [ ] Next action identified

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Responsible Role:** Sales Representative

## Escalation & Problem Resolution

**Common Issues:**

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution | Escalate To |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Prospect budget unrealistic | Prospect unfamiliar with custom pricing, expects stock pricing | Educate on value of custom work, offer scaled-down scope, refer to stock options | Sales Manager (if negotiation complex) |
| Timeline impossible | Prospect waited too long, urgent event, unrealistic expectations | Offer rush production (+50% fee), refer to partner for rush work, decline if truly impossible | Sales Manager (rush fee approval), Creative Director (feasibility check) |
| Scope unclear or constantly changing | Prospect unsure of needs, lacks decision-making authority | Schedule consultation call, request written requirements, qualify decision-maker access | Sales Manager (if prospect difficult to work with) |
| No response after quote sent | Prospect experiencing sticker shock, found cheaper option, lost interest | Follow up sequence, offer payment plan, request feedback if declined | Sales Manager (after 3 follow-up attempts) |
| Competitor comparison shopping | Prospect gathering multiple quotes, price-focused | Emphasize value differentiators (quality, timeline, service), share testimonials, offer to match competitor on value (not just price) | Sales Manager (if pricing adjustment needed) |

**Escalation Path:**
1. First Level: Sales Manager (all pricing negotiations, difficult prospects, complex projects)
2. Second Level: Creative Director (technical feasibility, design complexity, timeline concerns)
3. Final Level: CEO (VIP clients, partnership opportunities, pricing exceptions >20%)
