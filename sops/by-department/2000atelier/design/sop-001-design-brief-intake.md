# SOP-001: Design Brief Intake Process

## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| SOP ID | SOP-001 |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Effective Date | 2026-02-02 |
| Owner Position | Creative Director |
| Review Date | 2027-02-02 |
| Status | Active |
| Supersedes | None |

## Purpose

This SOP establishes the standardized process for receiving, evaluating, and processing design requests from clients or internal stakeholders. Proper intake ensures:

- Complete information captured upfront, reducing revisions
- Realistic timeline and budget estimates
- Appropriate resource allocation to design projects
- Clear creative direction aligned with client vision
- Documented approval trail for scope and deliverables

Without this process, design projects suffer from scope creep, missed requirements, unrealistic client expectations, and miscommunication between sales, design, and production teams.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- All custom design requests for costumes, garments, and accessories
- Internal design projects initiated by Brand Ops or Corp Ops
- Design revision requests that significantly change original scope
- Character costume design for film, theater, and events
- High-fashion editorial pieces for brand marketing

**Out of Scope:**
- Stock item orders (no custom design work)
- Minor alterations to existing designs (handled via SOP-003)
- Pattern grading without design changes (handled via SOP-012)
- Rush orders bypassing standard intake (requires Creative Director approval)

## RABSIC Responsibility Matrix

| Role | Position/Department | Responsibility Description |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **R** (Responsible) | Design Coordinator | Executes intake process, gathers requirements, creates brief document |
| **A** (Accountable) | Creative Director | Final approval of project acceptance, resource allocation, timeline commitment |
| **B** (Backup) | Senior Designer | Covers intake when Design Coordinator unavailable |
| **S** (Support) | Sales Representative | Provides client context, budget parameters, relationship history |
| **I** (Informed) | Production Manager, Pattern Team Lead, Client | Notified when brief is approved and enters design queue |
| **C** (Consulted) | Lead Designer (assigned to project) | Consulted on technical feasibility, material availability, timeline realism |

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Receive Design Request

**Objective:** Capture initial request and determine if it requires full design brief intake.

**Actions:**
1. Receive request via one of these channels:
   - Email to design@2000atelier.com
   - Slack message in #design-requests channel
   - Sales handoff via Notion CRM (tagged @design-coordinator)
   - In-person or phone conversation (document immediately in Slack)

2. Within 2 business hours, acknowledge receipt:
   - Email/Slack reply: "Thank you for your design request. I'm reviewing the details and will schedule an intake call within 24 hours."
   - Log request in Notion Design Requests database with status "Received"

3. Conduct initial triage assessment:
   - **IF** request is for stock item modification → Route to SOP-003 (Design Revisions)
   - **IF** request is rush order (<7 days) → Escalate immediately to Creative Director
   - **IF** request lacks basic info → Send preliminary questionnaire (see Appendix A)
   - **ELSE** → Proceed to Step 2

**Quality Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Request logged in Notion within 2 hours
- [ ] Acknowledgment sent to requester
- [ ] Initial triage decision documented

**Estimated Time:** 15-30 minutes

**Responsible Role:** Design Coordinator

---

### Step 2: Schedule Intake Consultation

**Objective:** Arrange dedicated time to gather complete requirements from client or stakeholder.

**Actions:**
1. Review requester's availability preferences from initial communication

2. Send calendar invitation for 60-minute intake call:
   - **Subject:** "Design Brief Intake: [Project Name]"
   - **Attendees:** Requester, Design Coordinator, Sales Rep (if client project), assigned Lead Designer (if already known)
   - **Agenda in invite body:**

## Exceptions & Edge Cases

### Exception 1: Rush Orders (<7 days to delivery)

**When This Occurs:** Client requests final delivery in fewer than 7 calendar days from initial request.

**Modified Procedure:**
1. Immediately notify Creative Director via Slack and phone
2. Creative Director assesses feasibility within 2 hours
3. If accepted, condense Steps 2-4 into single 2-hour working session
4. Brief approval required same day (phone call acceptable)
5. Rush fee applied: +50% to standard pricing
6. Designer assigned immediately, all other projects deprioritized
7. Daily check-ins replace weekly check-ins

**Additional Approvals Required:** Creative Director (project acceptance), CEO (if budget >$5,000 or displaces existing client commitments)

---

### Exception 2: Internal Brand Projects (No External Client)

**When This Occurs:** Design request originates from Brand Ops or Corp Ops for marketing, editorial, or internal use.

**Modified Procedure:**
1. Sales Rep role removed from RABSIC matrix
2. Budget approval from CFO required before Step 5
3. Internal stakeholder = "client" for approval purposes
4. Timeline may be more flexible, but still documented
5. Internal billing/cost allocation documented in Notion
6. Follow all other standard steps

**Additional Approvals Required:** CFO (budget approval), Creative Director (project prioritization vs. revenue-generating client work)

---

### Exception 3: Revision Requests Post-Brief Approval

**When This Occurs:** Client requests scope changes after brief approved but before design work substantially complete (>50% of budgeted hours spent).

**Modified Procedure:**
1. Designer immediately notifies Design Coordinator
2. Design Coordinator schedules change request call with client (within 24 hours)
3. Assess impact:
   - Timeline impact: +[X] days
   - Budget impact: +$[X]
   - Resource impact: [new skills/materials needed]
4. Create "Brief Amendment" document (follows same template as original)
5. Amendment requires Creative Director approval before sending to client
6. Client must approve amendment in writing
7. Update Notion project with revised scope, timeline, budget
8. Notify all stakeholders of changes

**Additional Approvals Required:** Creative Director (amendment acceptance), Client (amendment approval), CFO (if budget increase >20%)

---

## Escalation & Problem Resolution

**Common Issues:**

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution | Escalate To |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Client unresponsive after intake | Lack of urgency, decision paralysis | Send reminder email at Day 3, phone call at Day 5, CC Sales Rep | Sales Rep (Day 7), Creative Director (Day 10) |
| Incomplete information from client | Client doesn't know requirements, unclear vision | Send detailed questionnaire, offer second intake call, provide examples | Lead Designer (creative guidance), Creative Director (if fundamental vision unclear) |
| Budget too low for scope | Client expectations unrealistic, Sales misquote | Present 3 options: reduce scope, increase budget, phased approach | Creative Director (pricing authority), Sales Manager (client relationship) |
| Timeline conflicts with capacity | Over-booked design team, unexpected project delays | Check for freelance designers, propose extended timeline, discuss priority with client | Creative Director (resource allocation), COO (if systemic capacity issue) |
| Technical feasibility concerns | Designer skill gap, material unavailable, construction technique unknown | Research specialist vendors, propose alternative approach, decline project | Creative Director (technical authority), External specialist consultation |

**Escalation Path:**
1. First Level: Creative Director (all project-level decisions)
2. Second Level: COO (resource/capacity constraints)
3. Final Level: CEO (client relationship risk, major budget variances)
