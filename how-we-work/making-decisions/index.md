# Making Decisions

How we clarify who does what on every decision.

## RABSIC Framework

We use RABSIC to assign accountability for decisions:

## Quick Reference

| Role | Meaning | Rule |
|------|---------|------|
| **R** (Responsible) | Does the work | Can have multiple, one is primary |
| **A** (Accountable) | Owns the outcome | **Exactly ONE per decision** |
| **B** (Backup) | Stands in if R unavailable | Only when needed |
| **S** (Support) | Helps R complete work | Active assistance |
| **I** (Informed) | Notified AFTER decision | Passive recipient |
| **C** (Consulted) | Provides input BEFORE | Two-way communication |

## Why We Use It

Clear accountability prevents confusion, duplication, and dropped work. When everyone knows their role, decisions move faster.
