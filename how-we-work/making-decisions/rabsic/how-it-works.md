# How RABSIC Works in Practice

## Example: Launching a New Product Line

**Decision:** Should we launch a new costume line for corporate events?

### RABSIC Matrix

| Role | Assignment | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **R** (Responsible) | Design Lead + Sales Lead | They research feasibility and prepare recommendation |
| **A** (Accountable) | CEO | Final authority on new product lines |
| **B** (Backup) | COO | Steps in if CEO unavailable |
| **S** (Support) | Finance, Operations | Provide cost analysis and capacity assessment |
| **I** (Informed) | All staff | Notified AFTER decision is made |
| **C** (Consulted) | Key clients, production team | Expertise sought BEFORE deciding |

### Workflow

2. **Decision Phase:** They prepare recommendation with support from Finance and Operations
3. **Approval:** CEO reviews and approves/rejects (Accountable)
4. **Notification:** All staff informed via Slack announcement (Informed)

## Tips

- **Start with Accountable:** Always identify the ONE owner first

- **Document it:** Write down the RABSIC matrix for major decisions
- **Review it:** If decisions are slow, check if RABSIC is unclear
