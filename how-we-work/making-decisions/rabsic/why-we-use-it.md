# Why We Use RABSIC

## The Problem

Without clear accountability:
- Decisions get stuck ("Who's supposed to decide this?")
- Work gets duplicated ("I thought you were doing that")
- Things fall through cracks ("I thought someone else was handling it")

## The Solution

RABSIC makes accountability explicit. Before any decision:
1. We assign exactly ONE Accountable owner
2. We identify who does the work (Responsible)
3. We clarify who to consult BEFORE and inform AFTER

## Benefits

**Speed:** No waiting to figure out who decides
**Clarity:** Everyone knows their role
**Accountability:** Can't pass the buck when there's exactly ONE Accountable
**Continuity:** Roles persist even when people change
