# How We Work

**Navigation:** [Wiki Home](../index.md) > **How We Work**

This section covers our operating principles, decision-making frameworks, and standard procedures. It's how we turn individual effort into collective progress.

---

## Key Sections

### [Making Decisions](./making-decisions/index.md)
How we decide who does what using the RABSIC framework. Every decision has one accountable owner.

### [SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)](./sops/index.md)
Step-by-step guides for repeatable processes. When a process runs through your hands, you should be able to hand it off without losing quality.

### [Daily Rhythms](./daily-rhythms.md)
How we structure days and weeks to maximize impact and reduce wasted effort.

## Core Principles

### The Snowball Metaphor

> "We're not each doing our own thing. We're rolling one snowball together."

Every day, ask yourself:
- **Direction:** Am I pushing toward the customer, or toward internal convenience?
- **Leverage:** Am I fixing the weakest link, or polishing something already strong?
- **Compound effect:** Will today's work make tomorrow easier?

### Position Over Person

Roles and responsibilities are tied to positions, not individuals. When someone changes roles, the work continues because it's documented and systematized. See [RABSIC](./making-decisions/rabsic/index.md) for details.

### System Over Individual

We trust structured processes, not just personal judgment. Good systems:
- Work even when the original person is gone
- Improve over time as we learn
- Treat everyone fairly

### Verification Before Completion

Work isn't done until it's verified. No "it should work" claims - show evidence. This applies to:
- Code (tests pass, builds succeed)
- Processes (outcomes measured, documented)
- Decisions (results tracked, learnings captured)

## The 50/100 Point System

### 50 Points: Task Completed
You did what was asked, on time, at the right quality. This is baseline.

### 100 Points: Task + Improvement
You completed the task AND made future work easier:
- Documented the process
- Created a template
- Fixed a recurring problem
- Shared a learning

The compound effect of everyone earning 100 points is exponential improvement.
