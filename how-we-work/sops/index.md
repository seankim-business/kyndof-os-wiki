# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

**Navigation:** [How We Work](../index.md) > **SOPs**

SOPs capture our repeatable processes so anyone can execute them consistently. When a process runs through your hands, you should be able to hand it off to someone else without losing quality or speed.

## Why SOPs Matter

At Kyndof, we believe knowledge shouldn't live in people's heads. Here's why:

- **People move on.** When someone leaves, their knowledge shouldn't leave with them.
- **Onboarding speeds up.** New team members can follow documented processes instead of shadowing for weeks.
- **Quality stays consistent.** The 10th time should be as good as the 100th time.
- **We can improve systematically.** You can't improve what you can't measure or describe.

SOPs are one form of "compounding knowledge" - every process documented makes the next person faster.

## When to Create an SOP

Create an SOP when:

- **Done twice.** If you've done it more than once, it'll happen again.
- **Multiple people.** Different people need to do the same task.
- **Quality matters.** Mistakes have real consequences (customer impact, compliance, cost).
- **It's complex.** More than 5 steps, or requires judgment calls.

Don't create an SOP for:
- One-time tasks
- Things that change every time
- Simple, obvious actions (like "log into Slack")

## SOP Format

Every SOP follows this structure:

### 1. Purpose
Why does this process exist? What's the end goal?

### 2. Scope
When do you use this SOP? What triggers it?

### 3. Prerequisites
What do you need before starting? (Access, tools, approvals)

### 4. RABSIC Assignment
Who's involved?
- **R (Responsible):** Who does the work
- **A (Accountable):** Who owns the outcome
- **S (Support):** Who helps if needed
- **I (Informed):** Who gets notified when done

### 5. Step-by-Step Instructions
Numbered, specific, actionable steps. Include:
- Screenshots where helpful
- Links to tools or templates
- Decision points and how to handle them

### 6. Verification
How do you know it's done correctly?

### 7. Troubleshooting
Common problems and how to fix them.

## How to Create a New SOP

When you discover a process that needs documentation:

**Step 1: Capture the Current State**
- Write down what you actually do (not what you think you should do)
- Note the tools, decisions, and handoffs involved
- Ask colleagues if they do it differently

**Step 2: Structure It**
- Use the SOP Format above
- Keep steps atomic (one action per step)
- Include "why" explanations for non-obvious steps

**Step 3: Test It**
- Have someone else follow your SOP
- Watch where they get confused
- Fix those parts

**Step 4: Publish and Share**
- Add to this wiki
- Link from relevant team pages
- Announce in team Slack channel

**Step 5: Maintain It**
- Review quarterly
- Update when processes change
- Archive when obsolete

## Work Guidelines Integration

Our SOPs connect to Kyndof's broader work principles:

### The Daily Rhythm

**Start of Day (5-10 minutes):**
1. Clear your inbox - Slack, email, Tasks DB
2. Ask yourself the four alignment questions:
   - What Project does this Task belong to?
   - What OKR/Goal does that Project serve?
   - What Brand Goal or Vision does it support?
   - What's the biggest "snowball" I can roll today?
3. Pick your Top 3 tasks for the day

**During the Day:**
- Work in 60-90 minute focused blocks
- Update task status: ToDo > Doing > Done
- When stuck, signal immediately (don't struggle alone)

**End of Day (5-10 minutes):**
- Did today's work make the company stronger?
- Did I document what I learned?
- What are tomorrow's Top 3?

### The 50/100 Point System

**50 Points:** You completed the task on time and to spec. This is baseline.

**100 Points:** You completed the task AND made the next time easier:
- Documented a process
- Created a template
- Fixed a recurring problem
- Shared a learning with the team

## SOP Ownership

Every SOP has an owner (a role, not a person) responsible for:
- Keeping it accurate
- Reviewing it quarterly
- Training others on it
- Archiving it when obsolete

If you find an outdated SOP:
1. Note what's wrong
2. Contact the owner role
3. If urgent, propose a fix and tag the owner
