# Daily Rhythms: How We Structure Time

**Navigation:** [How We Work](./index.md) > **Daily Rhythms**

This guide explains how Kyndof structures days, weeks, and quarters for maximum effectiveness. These aren't suggestions - they're the operating rhythm we all follow.

## The Daily Cycle

### Morning: Align (5-10 minutes)

Before diving into work, get oriented.

**Step 1: Clear the Inbox**
Scan Slack, email, and Tasks DB. Pull everything into visibility. Don't act yet - just capture.

**Step 2: Ask the Alignment Questions**
For each task, ask:
- What Project does this Task belong to?
- What OKR/Goal does that Project serve?
- What Brand Goal or Vision does it connect to?
- What's the biggest snowball I can roll today?

**Step 3: Choose Your Top 3**
Pick maximum three things that must get done today.
- Name them with action verbs: "Draft client proposal" not "proposal"
- Set specific deadlines
- Enter them in Tasks DB

### Midday: Focus (Core hours)

**Work in timeboxes.** 60-90 minute focused blocks. One task per block. During a block:
- Minimize Slack notifications
- Close unnecessary tabs
- Work on one thing only

**Update status actively.** Move tasks through: Inbox → ToDo → Doing → Done. Others should see your progress without asking.

**Signal blockers immediately.** If you're stuck:
- Don't struggle alone for hours
- Flag it via Tasks comment or Slack thread
- Tag the relevant RABSIC roles (A or S/C)

**Think beyond your function.** Your step finishing doesn't mean the work is done. It's done when:
- The next person can start their step
- OR the customer receives value

### Evening: Reflect (5-10 minutes)

Before leaving, check:

- Did I grow the snowball today? (Compound work, not disappearing work)
- Did I document what I learned? (Write it down so it survives you)
- Is there a failure or lesson to share? (Team learning > individual learning)
- What are tomorrow's Top 3 (roughly)? (Hit the ground running tomorrow)

> "Did today make Kyndof stronger for tomorrow?"

If the answer is unclear, do something differently tomorrow.

## The Weekly Cycle

### Monday: Weekly Sync

Team-level alignment:
- What are this week's top goals?
- Who's working on what?
- What blockers exist from last week?

### Mid-Week: Direction Check

If things feel off:
- Don't wait until Friday
- Have a 5-minute conversation with your lead
- Redirect before you're far down the wrong path

### Friday: Weekly Review

Team or individual reflection:
- What did we ship?
- What blocked us?
- What will we do differently next week?

---

## The Quarterly Cycle

Every quarter, verify the alignment chain:

```
Vision → Goals → Hypothesis → Strategies → OKRs → Projects → Tasks
```

You should always be able to explain:
- What Project or Task am I working on?
- What OKR does it support?
- What Goal does that serve?
- How does that advance our Vision?

If you can't draw a clear line, the work is suspect:
- Deprioritize it
- Reduce its scope
- Or stop it entirely

Work that doesn't connect to strategy is wasted effort.

## Compound Work vs. Disappearing Work

### What Disappears

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Explaining the same thing repeatedly | No documentation |
| Fixing the same issue over and over | No root cause fix |
| Work that only you understand | Knowledge trapped in your head |
| Decisions with no record | Team can't learn from them |

### What Compounds

| Pattern | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Write it down once | Everyone can reference it |
| Fix the root cause | Problem disappears permanently |
| Create templates/checklists | Next person starts faster |
| Share learnings publicly | Whole team improves |

**The question:** When this work is done, what remains?

If nothing, find a small way to leave something behind.

---

## Communication Rhythms

### Slack

**Default:** Asynchronous. Don't expect instant replies.
**Urgent:** DM or call. Everything else uses channels and threads.
**Never:** Gossip or complaints about colleagues. Issues go directly to the person or through formal channels.

### Meetings

**Before:** Documented agenda, expected outcomes, participant list
**During:** Live notes in Notion, capture decisions and action items
**After:** Action items in Tasks DB with RABSIC assigned

A meeting without documented outcomes is a meeting that didn't happen.

### Notion

Notion is our operating system:
- **Tasks DB:** Every unit of work
- **Projects DB:** Work with clear start and end
- **Goals/KPIs:** Direction and measurement

Rule: Important work exists in Tasks or Projects. "It's in my head" doesn't count.

## Making It Stick

These rhythms only work if everyone follows them. When in doubt:

**Morning:** Am I aligned with what matters?
**Midday:** Am I making progress visible?
**Evening:** Did today compound into tomorrow?
